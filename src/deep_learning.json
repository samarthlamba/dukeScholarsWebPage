In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which AI and DL systems may be applicable. Technical and clinical aspects to build a DL system to address those needs, and the potential challenges for clinical adoption are discussed.

DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients from an academic glaucoma practice. METHODS: Intraocular pressure was estimated by analyzing videos recorded using a standard slit-lamp microscope and fixed-force GAT. Video frames were labeled to identify the outline of the reference tonometer and the applanation mires. A deep learning model was trained to localize and segment the tonometer and mires. Intraocular pressure values were calculated from the deep learning-predicted tonometer and mire diameters using the Imbert-Fick formula. A separate test set was collected prospectively in which standard and automated GAT measurements were collected in random order by 2 independent masked observers to assess the deep learning model as well as interobserver variability. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraocular pressure measurements between standard and automated methods were compared. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-three eyes of 135 patients were included in the training and validation videos. For the test set, 50 eyes from 25 participants were included. Each eye was measured by 2 observers, resulting in 100 videos. Within the test set, the mean difference between automated and standard GAT results was -0.9 mmHg (95% limits of agreement [LoA], -5.4 to 3.6 mmHg). Mean difference between the 2 observers using standard GAT was 0.09 mmHg (LoA,-3.8 to 4.0 mmHg). Mean difference between the 2 observers using automated GAT videos was -0.3 mmHg (LoA, -4.1 to 3.5 mmHg). The coefficients of repeatability for automated and standard GAT were 3.8 and 3.9 mmHg, respectively. The bias for even-numbered measurements was reduced when using automated GAT. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary measurements using deep learning to automate GAT demonstrate results comparable with those of standard GAT. Automated GAT has the potential to improve on our current GAT measurement standards significantly by reducing bias and improving repeatability.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved single-center study, we analyzed DCE-MR images of 270 patients at our institution. Lesions of interest were identified by radiologists. The task was to automatically determine whether the tumor is of the Luminal A subtype or of another subtype based on the MR image patches representing the tumor. Three different deep learning approaches were used to classify the tumor according to their molecular subtypes: learning from scratch where only tumor patches were used for training, transfer learning where networks pre-trained on natural images were fine-tuned using tumor patches, and off-the-shelf deep features where the features extracted by neural networks trained on natural images were used for classification with a support vector machine. Network architectures utilized in our experiments were GoogleNet, VGG, and CIFAR. We used 10-fold crossvalidation method for validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) as the measure of performance. RESULTS: The best AUC performance for distinguishing molecular subtypes was 0.65 (95% CI:[0.57,0.71]) and was achieved by the off-the-shelf deep features approach. The highest AUC performance for training from scratch was 0.58 (95% CI:[0.51,0.64]) and the best AUC performance for transfer learning was 0.60 (95% CI:[0.52,0.65]) respectively.

Identifying smoking risk environments from images of a smoker's daily life provides a basis for environment-based interventions. Objective: To apply a deep learning approach to the clinically relevant identification of smoking environments among settings that smokers encounter in daily life. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, 4902 images of smoking (nâ=â2457) and nonsmoking (nâ=â2445) locations were photographed by 169 smokers from Durham, North Carolina, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, areas from 2010 to 2016. These images were used to develop a probabilistic classifier to predict the location type (smoking or nonsmoking location), thus relating objects and settings in daily environments to established smoking patterns. The classifier combines a deep convolutional neural network with an interpretable logistic regression model and was trained and evaluated via nested cross-validation with participant-wise partitions (ie, out-of-sample prediction). To contextualize model performance, images taken by 25 randomly selected participants were also classified by smoking cessation experts. As secondary validation, craving levels reported by participants when viewing unfamiliar environments were compared with the model's predictions. Data analysis was performed from September 2017 to May 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Classifier performance (accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]), comparison with 4 smoking cessation experts, contribution of objects and settings to smoking environment status (standardized model coefficients), and correlation with participant-reported craving. Results: Of 169 participants, 106 (62.7%) were from Durham (53 [50.0%] female; mean [SD] age, 41.4 [12.0] years) and 63 (37.3%) were from Pittsburgh (31 [51.7%] female; mean [SD] age, 35.2 [13.8] years). A total of 4902 images were available for analysis, including 3386 from Durham (mean [SD], 31.9 [1.3] images per participant) and 1516 from Pittsburgh (mean [SD], 24.1 [0.5] images per participant). Images were evenly split between the 2 classes, with 2457 smoking images (50.1%) and 2445 nonsmoking images (49.9%). The final model discriminated smoking vs nonsmoking environments with a mean (SD) AUC of 0.840 (0.024) (accuracy [SD], 76.5% [1.6%]). A model trained only with images from Durham participants effectively classified images from Pittsburgh participants (AUC, 0.757; accuracy, 69.2%), and a model trained only with images from Pittsburgh participants effectively classified images from Durham participants (AUC, 0.821; accuracy, 75.0%), suggesting good generalizability between geographic areas. Only 1 expert's performance was a statistically significant improvement compared with the classifier (Î±â=â.05). Median self-reported craving was significantly correlated with model-predicted smoking environment status (Ïâ=â0.894; Pâ=â.003). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, features of daily environments predicted smoking vs nonsmoking status consistently across participants. The findings suggest that a deep learning approach can identify environments associated with smoking, can predict the probability that any image of daily life represents a smoking environment, and can potentially trigger environment-based interventions. This work demonstrates a framework for predicting how daily environments may influence target behaviors or symptoms that may have broad applications in mental and physical health.", "publication_location": "Jama Network Open", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.7939", "citations": "1", "readership": "12", "tweets": "19", "news_mentions": " "},

For the 99 test nodules, the proposed deep learning algorithm achieved 13 of 15 (87%: 95% confidence interval [CI]: 67%, 100%) sensitivity, the same as expert consensus (P > .99) and higher than five of nine radiologists. The specificity of the deep learning algorithm was 44 of 84 (52%; 95% CI: 42%, 62%), which was similar to expert consensus (43 of 84; 51%; 95% CI: 41%, 62%; P = .91) and higher than seven of nine other radiologists. The mean sensitivity and specificity for the nine radiologists was 83% (95% CI: 64%, 98%) and 48% (95% CI: 37%, 59%), respectively.ConclusionSensitivity and specificity of a deep learning algorithm for thyroid nodule biopsy recommendations was similar to that of expert radiologists who used American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging and Reporting Data System guidelines.Â© RSNA, 2019Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "publication_location": "Radiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2019181343", "citations": "14", "readership": "48", "tweets": "52", "news_mentions": "4"},

An important problem in fiber-optic communications is to invert the nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger equation in real time to reverse the deterministic effects of the channel. Interestingly, the popular split-step Fourier method (SSFM) leads to a computation graph that is reminiscent of a deep neural network. This observation allows one to leverage tools from machine learning to reduce complexity. In particular, the main disadvantage of the SSFM is that its complexity using M steps is at least M times larger than a linear equalizer. This is because the linear SSFM operator is a dense matrix. In previous work, truncation methods such as frequency sampling, wavelets, or least-squares have been used to obtain 'cheaper' operators that can be implemented using filters. However, a large number of filter taps are typically required to limit truncation errors. For example, Ip and Kahn showed that for a 10 Gbaud signal and 2000 km optical link, a truncated SSFM with 25 steps would require 70-tap filters in each step and 100 times more operations than linear equalization. We find that, by jointly optimizing all filters with deep learning, the complexity can be reduced significantly for similar accuracy. Using optimized 5-tap and 3-tap filters in an alternating fashion, one requires only around 2-6 times the complexity of linear equalization, depending on the implementation.", "publication_location": "Ieee International Symposium on Information Theory   Proceedings", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2018.8437734", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

This boosts the convergence time and accuracy by learning only healthy and defected brain tissues. To overcome the class imbalance problem, we sample an equal number of pixels from each class.

Convolution neural networks (CNNs) are the heart of deep learning applications. Recent works PRIME [1] and ISAAC [2] demonstrated the promise of using resistive random access memory (ReRAM) to perform neural computations in memory. We found that training cannot be efficiently supported with the current schemes. First, they do not consider weight update and complex data dependency in training procedure. Second, ISAAC attempts to increase system throughput with a very deep pipeline. It is only beneficial when a large number of consecutive images can be fed into the architecture. In training, the notion of batch (e.g. 64) limits the number of images can be processed consecutively, because the images in the next batch need to be processed based on the updated weights. Third, the deep pipeline in ISAAC is vulnerable to pipeline bubbles and execution stall. In this paper, we present PipeLayer, a ReRAM-based PIM accelerator for CNNs that support both training and testing. We analyze data dependency and weight update in training algorithms and propose efficient pipeline to exploit inter-layer parallelism. To exploit intra-layer parallelism, we propose highly parallel design based on the notion of parallelism granularity and weight replication. With these design choices, PipeLayer enables the highly pipelined execution of both training and testing, without introducing the potential stalls in previous work.

In this paper, symmetric residual convolutional neural network (SR-CNN), a deep learning based model, was proposed to enhance the sharpness of edges and detailed anatomical structures in under-sampled cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). For training, CBCT images were reconstructed using TV-based method from limited projections simulated from the ground truth CT, and were fed into SR-CNN, which was trained to learn a restoring pattern from under-sampled images to the ground truth. For testing, under-sampled CBCT was reconstructed using TV regularization and was then augmented by SR-CNN. Performance of SR-CNN was evaluated using phantom and patient images of various disease sites acquired at different institutions both qualitatively and quantitatively using structure similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). SR-CNN substantially enhanced image details in the TV-based CBCT across all experiments. In the patient study using real projections, SR-CNN augmented CBCT images reconstructed from as low as 120 half-fan projections to image quality comparable to the reference fully-sampled FDK reconstruction using 900 projections. In the tumor localization study, improvements in the tumor localization accuracy were made by the SR-CNN augmented images compared with the conventional FDK and TV-based images. SR-CNN demonstrated robustness against noise levels and projection number reductions and generalization for various disease sites and datasets from different institutions.

In distributed machine learning, while a great deal of attention has been paid on centralized systems that include a central parameter server, decentralized systems have not been fully explored. Decentralized systems have great potentials in the future practical use as they have multiple useful attributes such as less vulnerable to privacy and security issues, better scalability, and less prone to single point of bottleneck and failure. In this paper, we focus on decentralized learning systems and aim to achieve differential privacy with good convergence rate and low communication cost. To achieve this goal, we propose a new algorithm, Leader-Follower Elastic Averaging Stochastic Gradient Descent (LEASGD), driven by a novel Leader-Follower topology and differential privacy model. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence rate of LEASGD and the trade-off between the performance and privacy in the private setting. We evaluate LEASGD in real distributed testbed with poplar deep neural network models MNIST-CNN, MNIST-RNN, and CIFAR-10. Extensive experimental results show that LEASGD outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized learning algorithm DPSGD by achieving nearly 40% lower loss function within same iterations and by 30% reduction of communication cost.

Deep neural network (DNN) accelerators as an example of domain-specific architecture have demonstrated great success in DNN inference. However, the architecture acceleration for equally important DNN training has not yet been fully studied. With data forward, error backward and gradient calculation, DNN training is a more complicated process with higher computation and communication intensity. Because the recent research demonstrates a diminishing specialization return, namely, 'accelerator wall', we believe that a promising approach is to explore coarse-grained parallelism among multiple performance-bounded accelerators to support DNN training. Distributing computations on multiple heterogeneous accelerators to achieve high throughput and balanced execution, however, remaining challenging. We present AccPar, a principled and systematic method of determining the tensor partition among heterogeneous accelerator arrays. Compared to prior empirical or unsystematic methods, AccPar considers the complete tensor partition space and can reveal previously unknown new parallelism configurations. AccPar optimizes the performance based on a cost model that takes into account both computation and communication costs of a heterogeneous execution environment. Hence, our method can avoid the drawbacks of existing approaches that use communication as a proxy of the performance. The enhanced flexibility of tensor partitioning in AccPar allows the flexible ratio of computations to be distributed among accelerators with different performances. The proposed search algorithm is also applicable to the emerging multi-path patterns in modern DNNs such as ResNet.

However, considerable variability in image analysis techniques can lead to inconsistent results. We have developed quantitative imaging for application in the preclinical arm of a coclinical trial by using a genetically engineered mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images were acquired 1 day before and 1 week after radiation therapy. After the second MRI, the primary tumor was surgically removed by amputating the tumor-bearing hind limb, and mice were followed for up to 6âmonths. An automatic analysis pipeline was used for multicontrast MRI data using a convolutional neural network for tumor segmentation followed by radiomics analysis. We then calculated radiomics features for the tumor, the peritumoral area, and the 2 combined. The first radiomics analysis focused on features most indicative of radiation therapy effects; the second radiomics analysis looked for features that might predict primary tumor recurrence. The segmentation results indicated that Dice scores were similar when using multicontrast versus single T2-weighted data (0.863 vs 0.861). One week post RT, larger tumor volumes were measured, and radiomics analysis showed greater heterogeneity. In the tumor and peritumoral area, radiomics features were predictive of primary tumor recurrence (AUC: 0.79).

Deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in particular are increasingly popular tools for segmentation and classification of medical images. CNNs were shown to be successful for segmentation of brain tumors into multiple regions or labels. However, in the environment which fosters data-sharing and collection of multi-institutional datasets, a question arises: does training with data from another institution with potentially different imaging equipment, contrast protocol, and patient population impact the segmentation performance of the CNN? Our study presents preliminary data towards answering this question. Specifically, we used MRI data of glioblastoma (GBM) patients for two institutions present in The Cancer Imaging Archive. We performed a process of training and testing CNN multiple times such that half of the time the CNN was tested on data from the same institution that was used for training and half of the time it was tested on another institution, keeping the training and testing set size constant. We observed a decrease in performance as measured by Dice coefficient when the CNN was trained with data from a different institution as compared to training with data from the same institution. The changes in performance for the entire tumor and for four different labels within the tumor were: 0.72 to 0.65 (p=0.06), 0.61 to 0.58 (p=0.49), 0.54 to 0.51 (p=0.82), 0.31 to 0.24 (p<0.03), and 0.43 to 0.31(p<0.003) respectively.

This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using a novel distance-based representation of 3D CT-scan images to train a deep learning model for dose predictions in radiation treatment planning. The distance representation is inspired by previous knowledge of the domain to increase the generalizability of the deep learning models for radiation treatment planning. Conventional knowledge-based planning methods extract engineered features from 3D CT-scan images, as well as other patients' features, to predict the best achievable dose in a cancerous area and other organs at risk. Recent studies have shown higher accuracy in voxel-level dose prediction using deep learning models compared to the conventional machine learning approaches. Since the data resources for training these models are limited, most of the studies use 2D contour information to represent the patient anatomy. This representation loses volumetric information, and it is sensitive to small changes in patient orientation and translation. The distance-based representation introduced in this paper is inspired by the domain knowledge and is able to maintain the volumetric distance information despite the 2D slicing of 3D CT-image. According to prior studies in the radiation treatment planning domain, there is a strong association between the organs-at-risk distance from the cancerous volume and the patient's vulnerability to receive excessive dose. Therefore, the contour value in prior representation was replaced by voxel distance from cancerous volume. This modification in representation makes it transition and orientation invariant and adds potential robustness to patient positioning differences during the imaging/planning process. We evaluated the distance-based deep learning models through experiments for prediction of prostate cancer patients' vulnerability and voxel-level dose distribution using convolutional neural network and U-net models, respectively. The results were compared with contour-based U-net model as well as conventional machine learning with engineered representations. We found that the performance was comparable or higher than the prior state-of-the-art results for prostate-cancer dose distribution prediction.", "publication_location": "Proceedings   2019 Ieee International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine, Bibm 2019", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BIBM47256.2019.8983412", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": "3", "news_mentions": " "},

Distracted driving is known to be the leading cause of motor vehicle accidents. With the increase in the number of IoT devices available within vehicles, there exists an abundance of data for monitoring driver behavior. However, designing a system around this goal presents two key challenges - how to concurrently collect data spanning multiple IoT devices, and how to jointly analyze this multimodal input. To that end, we present a unified data collection and analysis framework, DarNet, capable of detecting and classifying distracted driving behavior. DarNet consists of two primary components: A data collection system and an analytics engine. Our system takes advantage of advances in machine learning (ML) to classify driving behavior based on input sensor data. In our system implementation, we collect image data from an inward facing camera, and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data from a mobile device, both located within the vehicle. Using deep learning techniques, we show that DarNet achieves a Top-1 classification percentage of 87.02% on our collected dataset, significantly outperforming our baseline model of 73.88%.

Its simplicity and cost-effectiveness has enabled a variety of biomedical applications, such as continuous long-term monitoring of heart arrhythmias, fitness, and sleep tracking, and hydration monitoring. One major issue that can hinder PPG-based applications is movement artifacts, which can lead to false interpretations. In many implementations, noisy PPG signals are discarded. Misinterpreted or discarded PPG signals pose a problem in applications where the goal is to increase the yield of detecting physiological events, such as in the case of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF)-a common episodic heart arrhythmia and a leading risk factor for stroke. In this work, we compared a traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches for PPG quality assessment in the presence of AF, in order to find the most robust method for PPG quality assessment. APPROACH:The training data set was composed of 78â278 30âs long PPG recordings from 3764 patients using bedside patient monitors. Two different representations of PPG signals were employed-a time-series based (1D) one and an image-based (2D) one.

METHODS: Two phantom experiments were performed. The first used a multisized image quality phantom (Mercury v3.0, Duke University) imaged at five radiation dose levels (CTDIvol : 0.9, 1.2, 3.6, 7.0, and 22.3Â mGy) with a fixed tube current technique on a commercial CT scanner (GE Revolution CT). Images were reconstructed with conventional (FBP), iterative (GE ASiR-V), and deep learning-based (GE True Fidelity) reconstruction algorithms. Noise power spectrum (NPS), high-contrast (air-polyethylene interface), and intermediate-contrast (water-polyethylene interface) task transfer functions (TTF) were measured for each dose level and phantom size and summarized in terms of average noise frequency (fav ) and frequency at which the TTF was reduced to 50% (f50% ), respectively. The second experiment used a custom phantom with low-contrast rods and lung texture sections for the assessment of low-contrast TTF and noise spatial distribution. The phantom was imaged at five dose levels (CTDIvol : 1.0, 2.1, 3.0, 6.0, and 10.0Â mGy) with 20 repeated scans at each dose, and images reconstructed with the same reconstruction algorithms. The local noise stationarity was assessed by generating spatial noise maps from the ensemble of repeated images and computing a noise inhomogeneity index,                         Î·                     , following AAPM TG233 methods. All measurements were compared among the algorithms. RESULTS: Compared to FBP, noise magnitude was reduced on average (Â± one standard deviation) by 74Â Â±Â 6% and 68Â Â±Â 4% for ASiR-V (at \"100%\" setting) and True Fidelity (at \"High\" setting), respectively. The noise texture from ASiR-V had substantially lower noise frequency content with 55Â Â±Â 4% lower NPS fav compared to FBP while True Fidelity had only marginally different noise frequency content with 9Â Â±Â 5% lower NPS fav compared to FBP. Both ASiR-V and True Fidelity demonstrated locally nonstationary noise in a lung texture background at all radiation dose levels, with higher noise near high-contrast edges of vessels and lower noise in uniform regions. At the 1.0Â mGy dose level                         Î·                     values were 314% and 271% higher in ASiR-V and True Fidelity compared to FBP, respectively. High-contrast spatial resolution was similar between all algorithms for all dose levels and phantom sizes (<3% difference in TTF f50% ). Compared to FBP, low-contrast spatial resolution was lower for ASiR-V and True Fidelity with a reduction of TTF f50% of up to 42% and 36%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning-based CT reconstruction demonstrated a strong noise magnitude reduction compared to FBP while maintaining similar noise texture and high-contrast spatial resolution. However, the algorithm resulted in images with a locally nonstationary noise in lung textured backgrounds and had somewhat degraded low-contrast spatial resolution similar to what has been observed in currently available iterative reconstruction techniques.", "publication_location": "Med Phys", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mp.14319", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": "5", "news_mentions": " "},

This time-consuming task typically requires expert radiologists to read the images, leading to fatigue-based diagnostic error and lack of diagnostic expertise in areas of the world where radiologists are not available. Recently, deep learning approaches have been able to achieve expert-level performance in medical image interpretation tasks, powered by large network architectures and fueled by the emergence of large labeled datasets. The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of a deep learning algorithm on the detection of pathologies in chest radiographs compared with practicing radiologists. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed CheXNeXt, a convolutional neural network to concurrently detect the presence of 14 different pathologies, including pneumonia, pleural effusion, pulmonary masses, and nodules in frontal-view chest radiographs. CheXNeXt was trained and internally validated on the ChestX-ray8 dataset, with a held-out validation set consisting of 420 images, sampled to contain at least 50 cases of each of the original pathology labels. On this validation set, the majority vote of a panel of 3 board-certified cardiothoracic specialist radiologists served as reference standard. We compared CheXNeXt's discriminative performance on the validation set to the performance of 9 radiologists using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The radiologists included 6 board-certified radiologists (average experience 12 years, range 4-28 years) and 3 senior radiology residents, from 3 academic institutions. We found that CheXNeXt achieved radiologist-level performance on 11 pathologies and did not achieve radiologist-level performance on 3 pathologies. The radiologists achieved statistically significantly higher AUC performance on cardiomegaly, emphysema, and hiatal hernia, with AUCs of 0.888 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.863-0.910), 0.911 (95% CI 0.866-0.947), and 0.985 (95% CI 0.974-0.991), respectively, whereas CheXNeXt's AUCs were 0.831 (95% CI 0.790-0.870), 0.704 (95% CI 0.567-0.833), and 0.851 (95% CI 0.785-0.909), respectively. CheXNeXt performed better than radiologists in detecting atelectasis, with an AUC of 0.862 (95% CI 0.825-0.895), statistically significantly higher than radiologists' AUC of 0.808 (95% CI 0.777-0.838); there were no statistically significant differences in AUCs for the other 10 pathologies. The average time to interpret the 420 images in the validation set was substantially longer for the radiologists (240 minutes) than for CheXNeXt (1.5 minutes). The main limitations of our study are that neither CheXNeXt nor the radiologists were permitted to use patient history or review prior examinations and that evaluation was limited to a dataset from a single institution.

In this approach, target features are extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN) operating on sonar images, and then classified by a support vector machine (SMV) that is trained based on manually labeled data. The proposed approach is tested on a set of sonar images obtained by a UUV equipped with side-scan sonar. Automatic target recognition is achieved through the use of matched filters, while target classification is achieved with the trained SVM classifier based on features extracted by the CNN. The results show that deep learning feature extraction provide better performance compared to using other feature extraction techniques such as histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and local binary pattern (LBP). By processing images autonomously, the proposed approach can be combined with onboard planning and control systems to develop autonomous UUVs able to search for underwater targets without human intervention.", "publication_location": "2017 Ieee 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control, Cdc 2017", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2017.8264055", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Evaluating the severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA) accounts for significant plain film workload and is a crucial component of knee radiograph interpretation, which informs surgical decision-making for costly and invasive procedures such as knee replacement. The Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading scale systematically and quantitatively assesses the severity of knee OA but is associated with notable inter-reader variability. In this study, we propose a deep learning method for the assessment of joint space narrowing (JSN) in the knee, which is an essential part of determining the KL grade. To determine the extent of JSN, we analyzed 99 knee radiographs to calculate the distance between the femur and tibia. Our algorithm's measurements of JSN and KL grade correlated well other radiologists' assessments. The average distance (in pixels) between the femur and tibia bones as measured by our algorithm was 9.60 for KL=0, 7.60 for KL=1, 6.89 for KL=2, 3.75 for KL=3, 1.25 for KL=4. Additionally, we used 100 manually annotated knee radiographs to train the algorithm to segment the femur and tibia bones. When evaluated on an independent set of 20 knee radiographs, the algorithm demonstrated a Dice coefficient of 96.59%.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, digital mammographic magnification views were collected for 99 subjects with DCIS at biopsy, 25 of which were subsequently upstaged to invasive cancer. A deep convolutional neural network model that was pretrained on nonmedical images (eg, animals, plants, instruments) was used as the feature extractor. Through a statistical pooling strategy, deep features were extracted at different levels of convolutional layers from the lesion areas, without sacrificing the original resolution or distorting the underlying topology. A multivariate classifier was then trained to predict which tumors contain occult invasive disease. This was compared with the performance ofÂ traditional \"handcrafted\" computer vision (CV) features previously developed specifically to assess mammographic calcifications. TheÂ generalization performance was assessed using Monte Carlo cross-validation and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Deep features were able to distinguish DCIS with occult invasion from pure DCIS, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.73). This performance was comparable with the handcrafted CV features (area under the curveÂ = 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.71) that were designed with prior domain knowledge.

With the rise of artificial intelligence in recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely used in many domains. To achieve high performance and energy efficiency, hardware acceleration (especially inference) of DNNs is intensively studied both in academia and industry. However, we still face two challenges: Large DNN models and datasets, which incur frequent off-chip memory accesses; and the training of DNNs, which is not well-explored in recent accelerator designs. To truly provide high throughput and energy efficient acceleration for the training of deep and large models, we inevitably need to use multiple accelerators to explore the coarse-grain parallelism, compared to the fine-grain parallelism inside a layer considered in most of the existing architectures. It poses the key research question to seek the best organization of computation and dataflow among accelerators. In this paper, we propose a solution HYPAR to determine layer-wise parallelism for deep neural network training with an array of DNN accelerators. HYPAR partitions the feature map tensors (input and output), the kernel tensors, the gradient tensors, and the error tensors for the DNN accelerators. A partition constitutes the choice of parallelism for weighted layers. The optimization target is to search a partition that minimizes the total communication during training a complete DNN. To solve this problem, we propose a communication model to explain the source and amount of communications. Then, we use a hierarchical layer-wise dynamic programming method to search for the partition for each layer. HYPAR is practical: The time complexity for the partition search in HYPAR is linear. We apply this method in an HMC-based DNN training architecture to minimize data movement. We evaluate HYPAR with ten DNN models from classic Lenet to large-size model VGGs, and the number of weighted layers of these models range from four to nineteen. Our evaluation finds that: The default Model Parallelism is indeed the worst; the default Data Parallelism is not the best; but hybrid parallelism can be better than either the default Data Parallelism or Model Parallelism in DNN training with an array of accelerators. Our evaluation shows that HYPAR achieves a performance gain of 3.39Ã and an energy efficiency gain of 1.51Ã compared to Data Parallelism on average, and HYPAR performs up to 2.40Ã better than \"one weird trick\".", "publication_location": "Proceedings   25th Ieee International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture, Hpca 2019", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2019.00027", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

ACM Machine learning technologies are increasingly developed for use in healthcare. While research communities have focused on creating state-of-the-art models, there has been less focus on real world implementation and the associated challenges to fairness, transparency, and accountability that come from actual, situated use. Serious questions remain underexamined regarding how to ethically build models, interpret and explain model output, recognize and account for biases, and minimize disruptions to professional expertise and work cultures. We address this gap in the literature and provide a detailed case study covering the development, implementation, and evaluation of Sepsis Watch, a machine learning-driven tool that assists hospital clinicians in the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. Sepsis is a severe infection that can lead to organ failure or death if not treated in time and is the leading cause of inpatient deaths in US hospitals. We, the team that developed and evaluated the tool, discuss our conceptualization of the tool not as a model deployed in the world but instead as a socio-technical system requiring integration into existing social and professional contexts. Rather than focusing solely on model interpretability to ensure fair and accountable machine learning, we point toward four key values and practices that should be considered when developing machine learning to support clinical decision-making: rigorously define the problem in context, build relationships with stakeholders, respect professional discretion, and create ongoing feedback loops with stakeholders. Our work has significant implications for future research regarding mechanisms of institutional accountability and considerations for responsibly designing machine learning systems.

Many researchers in the field of machine learning have addressed the problem of detecting anomalies within Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Training these machine learning algorithms requires a dataset of CT scans with identified anomalies (labels), usually, in specific organs. This represents a problem, since it requires experts to review thousands of images in order to create labels for these data. We aim to decrease human burden at labeling CT scans by developing a model that identifies anomalies within plain-text-based reports that then could be further used as a method to create labels for models based on CT scans. This study contains more than 4800 CT reports from Duke Health System, for which we aim to identify organ specific abnormalities. We propose an iterative active learning approach that consists of building a machine learning model to classify CT reports by abnormalities in different organs and then improving it by actively adding reports sequentially. At each iteration, clinical experts review the report that provides the model with highest expected information gain. This process is done in real time by using a web interface. Then, this datum is used by the model to improve its performance. We evaluated the performance of our method for abnormalities in kidneys and lungs. When starting with a model trained on 99 reports, the results show the model achieves an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.93 on the test set after adding 130 actively labeled reports to the model from an unlabeled pool of 4,000.

In this work, we assess the effect of cross-institutional training on the performance of CNNs. METHODS: We selected 44 glioblastoma (GBM) patients from two institutions in The Cancer Imaging Archive dataset. The images were manually annotated by outlining each tumor component to form ground truth. To automatically segment the tumors in each patient, we trained three CNNs: (a) one using data for patients from the same institution as the test data, (b) one using data for the patients from the other institution and (c) one using data for the patients from both of the institutions. The performance of the trained models was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients as well as Average Hausdorff Distance between the ground truth and automatic segmentations. The 10-fold cross-validation scheme was used to compare the performance of different approaches. RESULTS: Performance of the model significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) when it was trained on data from a different institution (dice coefficients: 0.68 Â± 0.19 and 0.59 Â± 0.19) as compared to training with data from the same institution (dice coefficients: 0.72 Â± 0.17 and 0.76 Â± 0.12).

Deep neural networks trained using a softmax layer at the top and the cross-entropy loss are ubiquitous tools for image classification. Yet, this does not naturally enforce intra-class similarity nor inter-class margin of the learned deep representations. To simultaneously achieve these two goals, different solutions have been proposed in the literature, such as the pairwise or triplet losses. However, these carry the extra task of selecting pairs or triplets, and the extra computational burden of computing and learning for many combinations of them. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play loss term for deep networks that explicitly reduces intra-class variance and enforces inter-class margin simultaneously, in a simple and elegant geometric manner. For each class, the deep features are collapsed into a learned linear subspace, or union of them, and inter-class subspaces are pushed to be as orthogonal as possible. Our proposed Orthogonal Low-rank Embedding (OLÃâ°) does not require carefully crafting pairs or triplets of samples for training, and works standalone as a classification loss, being the first reported deep metric learning framework of its kind. Because of the improved margin between features of different classes, the resulting deep networks generalize better, are more discriminative, and more robust. We demonstrate improved classification performance in general object recognition, plugging the proposed loss term into existing off-the-shelf architectures. In particular, we show the advantage of the proposed loss in the small data/model scenario, and we significantly advance the state-of-the-art on the Stanford STL-10 benchmark.", "publication_location": "Proceedings of the Ieee Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2018.00846", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

As a result, neural networks are often treated as âblack boxâ models, and in the past, have been trained purely to optimize the accuracy of predictions. In this work, we create a novel network architecture for deep learning that naturally explains its own reasoning for each prediction. This architecture contains an autoencoder and a special prototype layer, where each unit of that layer stores a weight vector that resembles an encoded training input. The encoder of the autoencoder allows us to do comparisons within the latent space, while the decoder allows us to visualize the learned prototypes. The training objective has four terms: an accuracy term, a term that encourages every prototype to be similar to at least one encoded input, a term that encourages every encoded input to be close to at least one prototype, and a term that encourages faithful reconstruction by the autoencoder. The distances computed in the prototype layer are used as part of the classification process.

Objective predictive risk scores were generated for each patient and used to categorize patients as \"high\" or \"low\" predicted risk for SSI. RESULTS: Actual institutional cohort SSI rates were 10/148 (6.8%) and 28/134 (20.9%) for high-risk ciNPT versus control, respectively (PÂ <Â 0.001), and 3/31 (9.7%) and 5/57 (8.8%) for low-risk ciNPT versus control, respectively (PÂ =Â 0.99). Application of the model to the institutional cohort suggested that 205/370 (55.4%) patients were matched with their appropriate intervention over closed surgical incision (high risk with ciNPT or low risk with control), and 165/370 (44.6%) were inappropriately matched. With the model applied to the cohort, the predicted SSI rate with perfect utilization would be 27/370 (7.3%), versus 12.4% actual rate, with estimated cost savings of $231-$458 per patient. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a subjective practice strategy, an objective risk-based strategy using prediction software may be associated with superior results in optimizing SSI rates and costs after vascular surgery.", "publication_location": "J Surg Res", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2020.02.012", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": "1", "news_mentions": " "},

The purpose of this work is to validate the application of a deep learning-based method for abdominal synthetic CT (sCT) generation by image evaluation and dosimetric assessment in a commercial proton pencil beam treatment planning system (TPS). This study proposes to integrate dense block into a 3D cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (cycle GAN) framework in an effort to effectively learn the nonlinear mapping between MRI and CT pairs. A cohort of 21 patients with co-registered CT and MR pairs were used to test the deep learning-based sCT image quality by leave-one-out cross validation.

In this study, we propose a fully automatic way to quantify tumor imaging characteristics using deep learning-based segmentation and test whether these characteristics are predictive of tumor genomic subtypes. We used preoperative imaging and genomic data of 110 patients from 5 institutions with lower-grade gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Based on automatic deep learning segmentations, we extracted three features which quantify two-dimensional and three-dimensional characteristics of the tumors. Genomic data for the analyzed cohort of patients consisted of previously identified genomic clusters based on IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion, DNA methylation, gene expression, DNA copy number, and microRNA expression. To analyze the relationship between the imaging features and genomic clusters, we conducted the Fisher exact test for 10 hypotheses for each pair of imaging feature and genomic subtype. To account for multiple hypothesis testing, we applied a Bonferroni correction. P-values lower than 0.005 were considered statistically significant.

METHODS: An M2M DL algorithm trained with RNFL thickness parameters from spectral-domain optical coherence tomography was applied to a subset of 490 fundus photos of 490 eyes of 370 subjects graded by 2 glaucoma specialists for the probability of glaucomatous optical neuropathy (GON), and estimates of cup-to-disc (C/D) ratios.

We propose a new approach using quantitative spectral-domain (SD) OCT data to train a DL algorithm to quantify glaucomatous structural damage on optic disc photographs. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 32 820 pairs of optic disc photographs and SD OCT retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) scans from 2312 eyes of 1198 participants. METHODS: The sample was divided randomly into validation plus training (80%) and test (20%) sets, with randomization performed at the patient level.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The DL algorithm performance was evaluated in the test sample by evaluating correlation and agreement between the predictions and actual SD OCT measurements. We also assessed the ability to discriminate eyes with glaucomatous visual field loss from healthy eyes with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

Methods for inferring molecular subtype from histologic images may identify patients most likely to benefit from further genomic testing. To identify patients who could benefit from molecular testing based on H&E stained histologic images, we developed an image analysis approach using deep learning. A training set of 571 breast tumors was used to create image-based classifiers for tumor grade, ER status, PAM50 intrinsic subtype, histologic subtype, and risk of recurrence score (ROR-PT). The resulting classifiers were applied to an independent test set (nâ=â288), and accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of each was assessed on the test set. Histologic image analysis with deep learning distinguished low-intermediate vs. high tumor grade (82% accuracy), ER status (84% accuracy), Basal-like vs. non-Basal-like (77% accuracy), Ductal vs. Lobular (94% accuracy), and high vs. low-medium ROR-PT score (75% accuracy). Sampling considerations in the training set minimized bias in the test set. Incorrect classification of ER status was significantly more common for Luminal B tumors. These data provide proof of principle that molecular marker status, including a critical clinical biomarker (i.e., ER status), can be predicted with accuracy >75% based on H&E features.

Practically, dual-energy data completion is accomplished by estimating missing projection data based on the imaging chain with the full FoV and then by appropriately truncating the analytical reconstruction of the data with the smaller FoV. While this approach works well in many clinical applications, there are applications which would benefit from spectral contrast estimates over the larger FoV (spectral extrapolation)-e.g. model-based iterative reconstruction, contrast-enhanced abdominal imaging of large patients, interior tomography, and combined temporal and spectral imaging. METHODS: To document the fidelity of spectral extrapolation and to prototype a deep learning algorithm to perform it, we assembled a data set of 50 dual-source, dual-energy abdominal x-ray CT scans (acquired at Duke University Medical Center with 5 Siemens Flash scanners; chain A: 50Â cm FoV, 100Â kV; chain B: 33Â cm FoV, 140Â kVÂ +Â Sn; helical pitch: 0.8). Data sets were reconstructed using ReconCT (v14.1, Siemens Healthineers): 768Â ÃÂ 768Â pixels per slice, 50Â cm FoV, 0.75Â mm slice thickness, \"Dual-Energy - WFBP\" reconstruction mode with dual-source data completion. A hybrid architecture consisting of a learned piecewise linear transfer function (PLTF) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained using 40 scans (five scans reserved for validation, five for testing). The PLTF learned to map chain A spectral contrast to chain B spectral contrast voxel-wise, performing an image domain analog of dual-source data completion with approximate spectral reweighting. The CNN with its U-net structure then learned to improve the accuracy of chain B contrast estimates by copying chain A structural information, by encoding prior chain A, chain B contrast relationships, and by generalizing feature-contrast associations. Training was supervised, using data from within the 33-cm chain B FoV to optimize and assess network performance. RESULTS: Extrapolation performance on the testing data confirmed our network's robustness and ability to generalize to unseen data from different patients, yielding maximum extrapolation errors of 26Â HU following the PLTF and 7.5Â HU following the CNN (averaged per target organ). Degradation of network performance when applied to a geometrically simple phantom confirmed our method's reliance on feature-contrast relationships in correctly inferring spectral contrast. Integrating our image domain spectral extrapolation network into a standard dual-source, dual-energy processing pipeline for Siemens Flash scanner data yielded spectral CT data with adequate fidelity for the generation of both 50Â keV monochromatic images and material decomposition images over a 30-cm FoV for chain B when only 20Â cm of chain B data were available for spectral extrapolation. CONCLUSIONS: Even with a moderate amount of training data, deep learning methods are capable of robustly inferring spectral contrast from feature-contrast relationships in spectral CT data, leading to spectral extrapolation performance well beyond what may be expected at face value.

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license Background: Radical measures are required to identify and reduce blindness due to diabetes to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) model using deep learning in a population-based diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Zambia, a lower-middle-income country. Methods: We adopted an ensemble AI model consisting of a combination of two convolutional neural networks (an adapted VGGNet architecture and a residual neural network architecture) for classifying retinal colour fundus images. We trained our model on 76 370 retinal fundus images from 13 099 patients with diabetes who had participated in the Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Program, between 2010 and 2013, which has been published previously. In this clinical validation study, we included all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes that attended a mobile screening unit in five urban centres in the Copperbelt province of Zambia from Feb 1 to June 31, 2012. In our model, referable diabetic retinopathy was defined as moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse, diabetic macular oedema, and ungradable images. Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy comprised severe non-proliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for referable diabetic retinopathy, and sensitivities of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema compared with the grading by retinal specialists. We did a multivariate analysis for systemic risk factors and referable diabetic retinopathy between AI and human graders. Findings: A total of 4504 retinal fundus images from 3093 eyes of 1574 Zambians with diabetes were prospectively recruited. Referable diabetic retinopathy was found in 697 (22Â·5%) eyes, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy in 171 (5Â·5%) eyes, and diabetic macular oedema in 249 (8Â·1%) eyes. The AUC of the AI system for referable diabetic retinopathy was 0Â·973 (95% CI 0Â·969â0Â·978), with corresponding sensitivity of 92Â·25% (90Â·10â94Â·12) and specificity of 89Â·04% (87Â·85â90Â·28). Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy sensitivity was 99Â·42% (99Â·15â99Â·68) and diabetic macular oedema sensitivity was 97Â·19% (96Â·61â97Â·77). The AI model and human graders showed similar outcomes in referable diabetic retinopathy prevalence detection and systemic risk factors associations. Both the AI model and human graders identified longer duration of diabetes, higher level of glycated haemoglobin, and increased systolic blood pressure as risk factors associated with referable diabetic retinopathy. Interpretation: An AI system shows clinically acceptable performance in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular oedema in population-based diabetic retinopathy screening. This shows the potential application and adoption of such AI technology in an under-resourced African population to reduce the incidence of preventable blindness, even when the model is trained in a different population.

Published by Elsevier Inc. PURPOSE: Acute cellular rejection (ACR), and its relation to chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in lung transplant patients. ACR occurs in more than one third of lung transplant recipients in the first year after transplantation; diagnosis largely rests on histopathologic evaluation of lung biopsy. The reproducibility of the diagnosis of ACR is quite variable, even among experienced transplant pathologists with published kappa values of interobserver agreement at 0.183 and 0.24-0.62. With digital pathology and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, it may be possible to aid pathologists in the diagnosis of ACR. Herein we examine, for the first time, if an AI machine learning algorithm can reliably distinguish the vascular component of rejection in lung transplant biopsies from normal lung. METHODS: At a single high-volume lung transplant center, annotations were completed by board-certified lung transplant pathologists from hematoxylin and eosin stained slides scanned using a Leica Aperio AT2 digital whole slide scanner at 40X magnification. Annotations were imported into a Python 3.7 development environment using the open-source 'Openslide' library. Keras with a tensorflow backend was used for AI modeling and training. All training was performed on a Windows 10 based PC with an Intel Core I-9 processor, 64gb of ram, and Nvidia GPU. RESULTS: A total of 3,349 annotations (2580 regions of normal, 769 lesions of A1/A2 rejection) were completed. For the training set, 614 A1/A2 lesions and 2064 regions of normal were evaluated. For the validation set, 155 A1/A2 lesions and 156 regions of normal were used to test the AI algorithm's accuracy. The algorithm distinguished the vascular component of ACR from normal alveolated lung tissue with 95% validation accuracy. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, our study is the first to provide evidence that an AI machine algorithm can reach acceptable, and possibly surpass, performance of current diagnostic standards of identifying ACR in lung transplant patients. Future studies should include multi-institutional validation testing.", "publication_location": "J Heart Lung Transplant", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2020.01.100", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Approximately 25% of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosed from core needle biopsy are subsequently upstaged to invasive cancer at surgical excision. Identifying patients with occult invasive disease is important as it changes treatment and precludes enrollment in active surveillance for DCIS. In this study, we investigated upstaging of DCIS to invasive disease using deep features. While deep neural networks require large amounts of training data, the available data to predict DCIS upstaging is sparse and thus directly training a neural network is unlikely to be successful. In this work, a pre-trained neural network is used as a feature extractor and a support vector machine (SVM) is trained on the extracted features. We used the dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRIs of patients at our institution from January 1, 2000, through March 23, 2014 who underwent MRI following a diagnosis of DCIS. Among the 131 DCIS patients, there were 35 patients who were upstaged to invasive cancer. Area under the ROC curve within the 10-fold cross-validation scheme was used for validation of our predictive model.

An automatic method that can predict whether a patient is likely to respond to anti-VEGF therapy can avoid unnecessary trial and error treatment strategies and promote the selection of more effective first-line therapies. The objective of this study is to automatically predict the efficacy of anti-VEGF treatment of DME in individual patients based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. We performed a retrospective study of 127 subjects treated for DME with three consecutive injections of anti-VEGF agents. Patients' retinas were imaged using spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) before and after anti-VEGF therapy, and the total retinal thicknesses before and after treatment were extracted from OCT B-scans. A novel deep convolutional neural network was designed and evaluated using pre-treatment OCT scans as input and differential retinal thickness as output, with 5-fold cross-validation. The group of patients responsive to anti-VEGF treatment was defined as those with at least a 10% reduction in retinal thickness following treatment. The predictive performance of the system was evaluated by calculating the precision, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The algorithm achieved an average AUC of 0.866 in discriminating responsive from non-responsive patients, with an average precision, sensitivity, and specificity of 85.5%, 80.1%, and 85.0%, respectively. Classification precision was significantly higher when differentiating between very responsive and very unresponsive patients. The proposed automatic algorithm accurately predicts the response to anti-VEGF treatment in DME patients based on OCT images.

METHODS: A random selection of 49 representative digitalized sections from surgical biopsies of TM was reviewed byÂ 16 panelists. We evaluated BAP1 expression and CDKN2A (p16) homozygous deletion. We conducted a comprehensive, integrated, transcriptomic analysis. An unsupervised deep learning algorithm was trained to classify tumors. RESULTS: The 16 panelists recorded 784 diagnoses on the 49 cases. Even though a Kappa value of 0.42 is moderate, the presence of a TM component was diagnosed in 51%. In 49% of the histological evaluation, the reviewers classified the lesion as EM in 53%, SM in 33%, or BM in 14%. Median survival was 6.7 months. Loss of BAP1 observed in 44% was less frequent in TM than in EM and BM. p16 homozygous deletion was higher in TM (73%), followed by BM (63%) and SM (46%).

Purpose To accurately segment organs from 3D CT image volumes using a 2D, multi-channel SegNet model consisting of a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder-decoder architecture. Method We trained a SegNet model on the extended cardiac-Torso (XCAT) dataset, which was previously constructed based on patient Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis (CAP) Computed Tomography (CT) studies from 50 Duke patients. Each study consists of one low-resolution (5-mm section thickness) 3D CT image volume and its corresponding 3D, manually labeled volume. To improve modeling on such small sample size regime, we performed median frequency class balancing weighting in the loss function of the SegNet, data normalization adjusting for intensity coverage of CT volumes, data transformation to harmonize voxel resolution, CT section extrapolation to virtually increase the number of transverse sections available as inputs to the 2D multi-channel model, and data augmentation to simulate mildly rotated volumes. To assess model performance, we calculated Dice coefficients on a held-out test set, as well as qualitative evaluation of segmentation on high-resolution CTs.

The ending of Moore's Law makes domain-specific architecture as the future of computing. The most representative is the emergence of various deep learning accelerators. Among the proposed solutions, resistive random access memory (ReRAM) based process-in-memory (PIM) architecture is anticipated as a promising candidate because ReRAM has the capability of both data storage and in-situ computation. However, we found that existing solutions are unable to efficiently support the computational needs required by the training of unsupervised generative adversarial networks (GANs), due to the lack of the following two features: 1) Computation efficiency: GAN utilizes a new operator, called transposed convolution. It inserts massive zeros in its input before a convolution operation, resulting in significant resource under-utilization; 2) Data traffic: The data intensive training process of GANs often incurs structural heavy data traffic as well as frequent massive data swaps. Our research follows the PIM strategy by leveraging the energy-efficiency of ReRAM arrays for vector-matrix multiplication to enhance the performance and energy efficiency. Specifically, we propose a novel computation deformation technique that can skip zero-insertions in transposed convolution for computation efficiency improvement.

METHODS: AIP-SFFP generates a prostate IMRT plan through predictions of fluence maps using the patient anatomy. No inverse planning is required. AIP-SFFP centralizes a custom-build deep learning neuro network for fluence map prediction. Predictions are imported to a commercial treatment planning system for dose calculation and plan generation. AIP-SFFP was demonstrated for prostate IMRT simultaneously-integrated-boost (SIB) planning (58.8Gy/70Gy to PTV58.8Gy/PTV70Gyin 25 fx). Training data was generated from 106 patients using a knowledge-based planning (KBP) plan generator. Two types of 2D projection images were designed to represent structures' sizes and locations, and a total of 8 projections were utilized to describe targets and organs-at-risk. Projections at 9 template beam angles were stacked as inputs for AI training. 14 patients were used as independent tests. The generated test plans were compared with the plans from the KBP training plan generator and clinic practice. RESULTS: After normalization (PTV70GyV70Gy=95%), all 14 AI plans met institutional criteria. The coverage of PTV58.8Gyin AI plans was comparable to KBP and Clinic plans without statistical significance. BODY D1ccand rectum D0.1ccof AI plans were slightly higher (<1Gy) compared to KBP and Clinic plans; in contrast, bladder D1ccand other rectum and bladder low dose in AI plans were slightly improved without clinical relevance. The overall isodose distribution in AI plans was comparable with KBP plans and clinical plans. AIP-SFFP generated each test plan within 20 seconds including prediction and dose calculation.

Our approaches use deep learning techniques combined with local multiscale model reduction methodologies to predict flow dynamics. Using reduced-order model concepts is important for constructing robust deep learning architectures since the reduced-order models provide fewer degrees of freedom. We consider flow dynamics in porous media as multi-layer networks in this work. More precisely, the solution (e.g., pressures and saturation) at the time instant n+1 depends on the solution at the time instant n and input parameters, such as permeability fields, forcing terms, and initial conditions. One can regard the solution as a multi-layer network, where each layer, in general, is a nonlinear forward map and the number of layers relates to the internal time steps. We will rely on rigorous model reduction concepts to define unknowns and connections between layers. It is critical to use reduced-order models for this purpose, which will identify the regions of influence and the appropriate number of variables. Furthermore, due to the lack of available observed fine data, the reduced-order model can provide us sufficient inexpensive data as needed. The designed deep neural network will be trained using both coarse simulation data which is obtained from the reduced-order model and observed fine data.

We used a cost-minimisation analysis to evaluate the potential savings of two deep learning approaches as compared with the current human assessment: a semi-automated deep learning model as a triage filter before secondary human assessment; and a fully automated deep learning model without human assessment. Methods: In this economic analysis modelling study, using 39 006 consecutive patients with diabetes in a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Singapore in 2015, we used a decision tree model and TreeAge Pro to compare the actual cost of screening this cohort with human graders against the simulated cost for semi-automated and fully automated screening models. Model parameters included diabetic retinopathy prevalence rates, diabetic retinopathy screening costs under each screening model, cost of medical consultation, and diagnostic performance (ie, sensitivity and specificity). The primary outcome was total cost for each screening model. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were done to gauge the sensitivity of the results to key model assumptions. Findings: From the health system perspective, the semi-automated screening model was the least expensive of the three models, at US$62 per patient per year. The fully automated model was $66 per patient per year, and the human assessment model was $77 per patient per year. The savings to the Singapore health system associated with switching to the semi-automated model are estimated to be $489 000, which is roughly 20% of the current annual screening cost. By 2050, Singapore is projected to have 1 million people with diabetes; at this time, the estimated annual savings would be $15 million.

Surveillance cameras today often capture NIR (near infrared) images in low-light environments. However, most face datasets accessible for training and verification are only collected in the VIS (visible light) spectrum. It remains a challenging problem to match NIR to VIS face images due to the different light spectrum. Recently, breakthroughs have been made for VIS face recognition by applying deep learning on a huge amount of labeled VIS face samples. The same deep learning approach cannot be simply applied to NIR face recognition for two main reasons: First, much limited NIR face images are available for training compared to the VIS spectrum. Second, face galleries to be matched are mostly available only in the VIS spectrum. In this paper, we propose an approach to extend the deep learning breakthrough for VIS face recognition to the NIR spectrum, without retraining the underlying deep models that see only VIS faces. Our approach consists of two core components, cross-spectral hallucination and low-rank embedding, to optimize respectively input and output of a VIS deep model for cross-spectral face recognition. Cross-spectral hallucination produces VIS faces from NIR images through a deep learning approach. Low-rank embedding restores a low-rank structure for faces deep features across both NIR and VIS spectrum. We observe that it is often equally effective to perform hallucination to input NIR images or low-rank embedding to output deep features for a VIS deep model for cross-spectral recognition. When hallucination and low-rank embedding are deployed together, we observe significant further improvement; we obtain state-of-the-art accuracy on the CASIA NIR-VIS v2.0 benchmark, without the need at all to re-train the recognition system.", "publication_location": "Proceedings   30th Ieee Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Cvpr 2017", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2017.720", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

As a result, the standard deep learning framework can be readily applied for learning semantic, highlevel properties of the shape. An indication of our success in bridging the gap between images and surfaces is the fact that our algorithm succeeds in learning semantic information from an input of raw low-dimensional feature vectors. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by presenting two applications: human body segmentation, and automatic landmark detection on anatomical surfaces.

Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. Deep learning methods have shown great promise in tackling challenging medical imaging tasks. Within the field of x-ray CT, deep learning for image denoising is of interest because of the fundamental link between ionizing radiation dose and diagnostic image quality, the limited availability of clinical projection data, and the computational expense of iterative reconstruction methods. Here, we work with 3D, temporal CT data (4D, cardiac CT), where redundancies in spatial sampling necessitate careful control of imaging dose. Specifically, using custom extensions to the Tensorflow and Keras machine learning packages, we construct and train a 4D, convolutional neural network (CNN) to denoise helical, cardiac CT data acquired in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. With the objective of accelerating iterative reconstruction, we train the CNN to map undersampled algebraic reconstructions of the 4D data to fully-sampled and regularized iterative reconstructions under mean-squared-error, perceptual loss, and low rank cost terms. Using phantom data for quantitative validation, we verify that the CNN robustly denoises static potions of the image without compromising temporal fidelity and that the CNN performs similarly to regularized, iterative reconstruction with the split Bregman method (CNN temporal RMSE: 142 HU; iterative temporal RMSE: 136 HU). Using in vivo validation and testing data excluded from CNN training, we verify that the CNN generalizes well, approximately reproducing the noise power spectrum of the iteratively reconstructed data (noise std. in water vial near heart, CNN: 62-73 HU, depending on cardiac phase; iterative: 94-100 HU), without degradation of spatial resolution (axial MTF, 10% cutoff, CNN: 2.69 lp/mm; iterative: 2.63 lp/mm).

Deep learning has achieved great success in image analysis and decision making in radiology. However, a large amount of annotated imaging data is needed to construct well-performing deep learning models. A particular challenge in the context of breast cancer is the number of available cases that contain cancer, given the very low prevalence of the disease in the screening population. The question arises whether normal cases, which in the context of breast cancer screening are available in abundance, can be used to train a deep learning model that identifies locations that are abnormal. In this study, we propose to achieve this goal through the generative adversarial network (GAN)-based image completion. Our hypothesis is that if a generative network has a difficulty to correctly complete a part of an image at a certain location, then such a location is likely to represent an abnormality. We test this hypothesis using a dataset of 4348 patients with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging from our institution. We trained our model on normal only images, to be able to fill in parts of images that were artificially removed. Then, using an independent test set, at different locations in the images, we measured how difficult it was for the network to reconstruct an artificially removed patch of the image. The difficulty was measured by mean squared error (MSE) between the original removed patch and the reconstructed patch. On average, the MSE was 2.11 times higher (with standard deviation equal to 1.01) at the locations containing expert-annotated cancerous lesions than that at the locations outside those abnormal locations. Our generative approach demonstrates a great potential for using this model to aid breast cancer detection.", "publication_location": "Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging   Proceedings of Spie", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2551379", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Deep learning reveals features of vertices of a large network that can be adapted in accommodating the similarity-based solutions to provide a flexible method of drug-target prediction. Results:We propose a similarity-based drug-target prediction method that enhances existing association discovery methods by using a topology-based similarity measure. DeepWalk, a deep learning method, is adopted in this study to calculate the similarities within Linked Tripartite Network (LTN), a heterogeneous network generated from biomedical linked datasets. This proposed method shows promising results for drug-target association prediction: 98.96% AUC ROC score with a 10-fold cross-validation and 99.25% AUC ROC score with a Monte Carlo cross-validation with LTN.

Radiogenomics is a field of investigation that attempts to examine the relationship between imaging characteris-tics of cancerous lesions and their genomic composition. This could offer a noninvasive alternative to establishing genomic characteristics of tumors and aid cancer treatment planning. While deep learning has shown its supe-riority in many detection and classification tasks, breast cancer radiogenomic data suffers from a very limited number of training examples, which renders the training of the neural network for this problem directly and with no pretraining a very difficult task. In this study, we investigated an alternative deep learning approach referred to as deep features or off-the-shelf network approach to classify breast cancer molecular subtypes using breast dynamic contrast enhanced MRIs. We used the feature maps of different convolution layers and fully connected layers as features and trained support vector machines using these features for prediction. For the feature maps that have multiple layers, max-pooling was performed along each channel. We focused on distinguishing the Luminal A subtype from other subtypes. To evaluate the models, 10 fold cross-validation was performed and the final AUC was obtained by averaging the performance of all the folds. The highest average AUC obtained was 0.64 (0.95 CI: 0.57-0.71), using the feature maps of the last fully connected layer. This indicates the promise of using this approach to predict the breast cancer molecular subtypes. Since the best performance appears in the last fully connected layer, it also implies that breast cancer molecular subtypes may relate to high level image features.", "publication_location": "Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging   Proceedings of Spie", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2295471", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Accurate dosing of therapeutics at target locations is crucial but difficult to achieve using subretinal injections due to leakage, and there is no method available to measure the volume of therapeutics successfully administered to the subretinal location during surgery. Here we introduce the first automatic method for quantifying the volume of subretinal blebs, using porcine eyes injected with Ringer's lactate solution as samples. DESIGN:Experimental study. METHODS:Microscope-integrated optical coherence tomography was utilized to obtain 3D visualization of subretinal blebs in porcine eyes at Duke Eye Center. Two different injection phases were imaged and analyzed in 15 eyes (30 volumes), selected from a total of 37 eyes. The inclusion/exclusion criteria were set independently from the algorithm-development and testing team. A novel lightweight, deep learning-based algorithm was designed to segment subretinal blebs boundaries. A cross-validation method was used to avoid selection bias. An ensemble-classifier strategy was applied to generate final results for the test dataset. RESULTS:The algorithm performs significantly better than four other state-of-the-art deep learning-based segmentation methods, achieving an F1 score of 93.86 Â± 1.17% and 96.90 Â± 0.59% on the independent test data for entry and full blebs, respectively.

Imaging phantoms are test patterns used to measure image quality in computer tomography (CT) systems.

Determining which image slices are suitable for analysis currently requires manual annotation of these patterns by an expert, as subtle defects may make an image unsuitable for measurement. We propose a method of automatically classifying these test patterns in a series of phantom images using deep learning techniques.

The classifier is trained and evaluated with over 3,500 phantom images acquired at a university medical center.

A series of ablation studies are employed to verify design aspects of the classifier and evaluate its performance under varying training conditions.

All rights reserved. Learning in deep models using Bayesian methods has generated significant attention recently. This is largely because of the feasibility of modern Bayesian methods to yield scalable learning and inference, while maintaining a measure of uncertainty in the model parameters. Stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms (SG-MCMC) are a family of diffusion-based sampling methods for large-scale Bayesian learning. In SG-MCMC, multivariate stochastic gradient thermostats (mSGNHT) augment each parameter of interest, with a momentum and a thermostat variable to maintain stationary distributions as target posterior distributions. As the number of variables in a continuous-time diffusion increases, its numerical approximation error becomes a practical bottleneck, so better use of a numerical integrator is desirable. To this end, we propose use of an efficient symmetric splitting integrator in mSGNHT, instead of the traditional Euler integrator. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more accurate, robust, and converges faster. These properties are demonstrated to be desirable in Bayesian deep learning. Extensive experiments on two canonical models and their deep extensions demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves general Bayesian posterior sampling, particularly for deep models.", "publication_location": "30th Aaai Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Aaai 2016", "link": null, "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

They involve finding a certain kind of spectral decomposition to obtain basis functions that can capture important structures or directions for the problem at hand. The most common spectral method is the principal component analysis (PCA). It utilizes the principal components or the top eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix to carry out dimensionality reduction as one of its applications. This data pre-processing step is often effective in separating signal from noise. PCA and other spectral techniques applied to matrices have several limitations. By limiting to only pairwise moments, they are effectively making a Gaussian approximation on the underlying data. Hence, they fail on data with hidden variables which lead to non-Gaussianity. However, in almost any data set, there are latent effects that cannot be directly observed, e.g., topics in a document corpus, or underlying causes of a disease. By extending the spectral decomposition methods to higher order moments, we demonstrate the ability to learn a wide range of latent variable models efficiently. Higher-order moments can be represented by tensors, and intuitively, they can encode more information than just pairwise moment matrices. More crucially, tensor decomposition can pick up latent effects that are missed by matrix methods. For instance, tensor decomposition can uniquely identify non-orthogonal components. Exploiting these aspects turns out to be fruitful for provable unsupervised learning of a wide range of latent variable models. We also outline the computational techniques to design efficient tensor decomposition methods. They are embarrassingly parallel and thus scalable to large data sets. Whilst there exist many optimized linear algebra software packages, efficient tensor algebra packages are also beginning to be developed. We introduce Tensorly, which has a simple python interface for expressing tensor operations. It has a flexible back-end system supporting NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow and MXNet amongst others.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly applied to multi-channel image data by matching the number of network input channels to the number of data channels, learning explicit relationships between channels. This provides a high degree of specificity to a particular problem, but may fail to generalize to a broader class of closely related problems. We propose a solution to this generalization problem in the context of spectral x-ray CT, where the scanning kVps (energy bins) and contrast are often variable. Specifically, we propose a novel CNN architecture which handles variable numbers of input channels, variable noise levels between channels, and variable modes of spectral contrast. We demonstrate our architecture in the application of preclinical, photon-counting, micro-CT, effectively replacing 1-2 hours of iterative reconstruction, with <10 minutes of analytical reconstruction and CNN regularization. Experimental validation shows the effectiveness of our approach when applied to both in vivo photon-counting validation data (4 energy thresholds) and to simulated, dual-energy CT data virtually acquired with an energy integrating detector. In both cases, the results output by the CNN provide greater spectral accuracy than analytical reconstruction alone, but suffer from some degradation of spatial resolution.

However, aligning images is a computationally expensive and fragile procedure, and methods that aggregate information must therefore be able to identify which regions have been accurately aligned and which have not, a task that requires high level scene understanding. In this work, we introduce a deep learning solution to video deblurring, where a CNN is trained end-toend to learn how to accumulate information across frames. To train this network, we collected a dataset of real videos recorded with a high frame rate camera, which we use to generate synthetic motion blur for supervision.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a valuable modality for evaluating breast abnormalities found in mammography and performing early disease detection in high-risk patients. However, images produced by various MRI scanners (e.g., GE Healthcare & Siemens) differ in terms of intensity and other image characteristics such as noise distribution. This is a challenge both for the evaluation of images by radiologists and for the computational analysis of images using radiomics or deep learning. For example, an algorithm trained on a set of images acquired by one MRI scanner may perform poorly on a dataset produced by a different scanner. Therefore, there is an urgent need for image harmonization. Traditional image to image translation algorithms can be used to solve this problem, but they require paired data (i.e. the same object imaged using different scanners). In this study, we utilize a deep learning algorithm that uses unpaired data to solve this problem through a bi-directional translation between MRI images. The proposed method is based on a cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) that uses two generator-discriminator pairs. The original CycleGAN struggles in preserving the structure (i.e. breast tissue characteristics and shape) during the translation. To overcome this, we modified the discriminator architecture and forced the penalization based on the structure at the scale of smaller patches. This allows the network to focus more on features pertaining to breast tissue.

While this connectivity is traditionally revealed by anatomical methods such as electron microscopy, an efficient alternative is to computationally infer functional connectivity from recordings of neural activity. However, these statistical techniques still require further refinement before they can be reliably applied to real data. Here, we report significant improvements to a deep learning method for functional connectomics, as assayed on synthetic ChaLearn Connectomics data. The method, which integrates recent advances in convolutional neural network architecture and model-free partial correlation coefficients, outperforms published methods on competition data and can achieve over 90% precision at 1% recall on validation datasets. This suggests that future application of the model to in vivo whole-brain imaging data in larval zebrafish could reliably recover on the order of 106 synaptic connections with a 10% false discovery rate. The model also generalizes to networks with different underlying connection probabilities and should scale well when parallelized across multiple GPUs.

This paper presents a processing pipeline for fusing 'raw' and / or feature-level multi-sensor data - upstream fusion - and initial results from this pipeline using imagery, radar, and radio frequency (RF) signals data to determine which tracked object, among several, hosts an emitter of interest. Correctly making this determination requires fusing data across these modalities. Our approach performs better than standard fusion approaches that make detection / characterization decisions for each modality individually and then try to fuse those decisions - downstream (or post-decision) fusion. Our approach (1) fully exploits the inter-modality dependencies and phenomenologies inherent in different sensing modes, (2) automatically discovers compressive hierarchical representations that integrate structural and statistical characteristics to enhance target / event discriminability, and (3) completely obviates the need to specify features, manifolds, or model scope a priori. This approach comprises a unique synthesis of Deep Learning (DL), topological analysis over probability measure (TAPM), and hierarchical Bayesian non-parametric (HBNP) recognition models. Deep Generative Networks (DGNs - a deep generative statistical form of DL) create probability measures that provide a basis for calculating homologies (topological summaries over the probability measures). The statistics of the resulting persistence diagrams are inputs to HBNP methods that learn to discriminate between target types and distinguish emitting targets from non-emitting targets, for example. HBNP learning obviates batch-mode off-line learning. This approach overcomes the inadequacy of pre-defined features as a means for creating efficient, discriminating, low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional multi-modality sensor data collected under difficult, dynamic sensing conditions. The invariant properties in the resulting compact representations afford multiple compressive sensing benefits, including concise information sharing and enhanced performance. Machine learning makes adaptivity a central feature of our approach. Adaptivity is critical because it enables flexible processing that automatically accommodates a broad range of challenges that non-adaptive, standard fusion approaches would typically require manual intervention to begin to address. These include (a) interest in unknown or unanticipated targets, (b) desire to be rapidly able to fuse between different combinations of sensor modalities, and (c) potential need to transfer information between platforms that host different sensors.

Weakly supervised disease classification of CT imaging suffers from poor localization owing to case-level annotations, where even a positive scan can hold hundreds to thousands of negative slices along multiple planes. Furthermore, although deep learning segmentation and classification models extract distinctly unique combinations of anatomical features from the same target class(es), they are typically seen as two independent processes in a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) pipeline, with little to no feature reuse. In this research, we propose a medical classifier that leverages the semantic structural concepts learned via multi-resolution segmentation feature maps, to guide weakly supervised 3D classification of chest CT volumes. Additionally, a comparative analysis is drawn across two different types of feature aggregation to explore the vast possibilities surrounding feature fusion. Using a dataset of 1593 scans labeled on a case-level basis via rule-based model, we train a dual-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform organ segmentation and binary classification of four representative diseases (emphysema, pneumonia/atelectasis, mass and nodules) in lungs. The baseline model, with separate stages for segmentation and classification, results in AUC of 0.791. Using identical hyperparameters, the connected architecture using static and dynamic feature aggregation improves performance to AUC of 0.832 and 0.851, respectively.

However, individual outcomes vary significantly. This study sought to use a machine learning algorithm to develop a model to predict outcomes after CRT. METHODS AND RESULTS: Models were developed with machine learning algorithms to predict all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization at 12 months post-CRT in the COMPANION trial (Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing, and Defibrillation in Heart Failure). The best performing model was developed with the random forest algorithm. The ability of this model to predict all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization and all-cause mortality alone was compared with discrimination obtained using a combination of bundle branch block morphology and QRS duration. In the 595 patients with CRT-defibrillator in the COMPANION trial, 105 deaths occurred (median follow-up, 15.7 months). The survival difference across subgroups differentiated by bundle branch block morphology and QRS duration did not reach significance (P=0.08). The random forest model produced quartiles of patients with an 8-fold difference in survival between those with the highest and lowest predicted probability for events (hazard ratio, 7.96; P<0.0001). The model also discriminated the risk of the composite end point of all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization better than subgroups based on bundle branch block morphology and QRS duration.

The convergence rate of this procedure matches the well-known convergence rate of gradient descent to first-order stationary points, up to log factors. When all saddle points are non-degenerate, all second-order stationary points are local minima, and our result thus shows that perturbed gradient descent can escape saddle points almost for free. Our results can be directly applied to many machine learning applications, including deep learning. As a particular concrete example of such an application, we show that our results can be used directly to establish sharp global convergence rates for matrix factorization.

In our study, we use three benchmark datasets of increasing complexity, MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, to investigate the effects of imbalance on classification and perform an extensive comparison of several methods to address the issue: oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding that compensates for prior class probabilities. Our main evaluation metric is area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) adjusted to multi-class tasks since overall accuracy metric is associated with notable difficulties in the context of imbalanced data. Based on results from our experiments we conclude that (i)Â the effect of class imbalance on classification performance is detrimental; (ii)Â the method of addressing class imbalance that emerged as dominant in almost all analyzed scenarios was oversampling; (iii)Â oversampling should be applied to the level that completely eliminates the imbalance, whereas the optimal undersampling ratio depends on the extent of imbalance; (iv)Â as opposed to some classical machine learning models, oversampling does not cause overfitting of CNNs; (v)Â thresholding should be applied to compensate for prior class probabilities when overall number of properly classified cases is of interest.", "publication_location": "Neural Netw", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2018.07.011", "citations": "262", "readership": "1038", "tweets": "218", "news_mentions": " "},

Recently, progress has been made in the supervised training of Convolutional Object Detectors (e.g. Faster R-CNN) for threat recognition in carry-on luggage using X-ray images. This is part of the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA's) mission to ensure safety for air travelers in the United States. Collecting more data reliably improves performance for this class of deep algorithm, but requires time and money to produce training data with threats staged in realistic contexts. In contrast to these hand-collected data containing threats, data from the real-world, known as the Stream-of-Commerce (SOC), can be collected quickly with minimal cost; while technically unlabeled, in this work we make a practical assumption that these are without threat objects. Because of these data constraints, we will use both labeled and unlabeled sources of data for the automatic threat recognition problem. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised approach for this problem which we call Background Adaptive Faster R-CNN. This approach is a training method for two-stage object detectors which uses Domain Adaptation methods from the field of deep learning. The data sources described earlier are considered two âdomainsâ: one a hand-collected data domain of images with threats, and the other a real-world domain of images assumed without threats. Two domain discriminators, one for discriminating object proposals and one for image features, are adversarially trained to prevent encoding domain-specific information. Penalizing this encoding is important because otherwise the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can learn to distinguish images from the two sources based on superficial characteristics, and minimize a purely supervised loss function without improving its ability to recognize objects. For the hand-collected data, only object proposals and image features completely outside of areas corresponding to ground truth object bounding boxes (background) are used. The losses for these domain-adaptive discriminators are added to the Faster R-CNN losses of images from both domains. This technique enables threat recognition based on examples from the labeled data, and can reduce false alarm rates by matching the statistics of extracted features on the hand-collected backgrounds to that of the real world data. Performance improvements are demonstrated on two independently-collected datasets of labeled threats.", "publication_location": "Smart Structures and Materials 2005: Active Materials: Behavior and Mechanics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2558542", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Furthermore, in many scientific applications, the goal is to be able to understand the underlying features related to the classification, which prohibits the blind application of deep networks. This motivates the development of a new model based on parameterized convolutional filters guided by previous neuroscience research; the filters learn relevant frequency bands while targeting synchrony, which are frequency-specific power and phase correlations between electrodes.

Breast mass detection in mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is an essential step in computerized breast cancer analysis. Deep learning-based methods incorporate feature extraction and model learning into a unified framework and have achieved impressive performance in various medical applications (e.g., disease diagnosis, tumor detection, and landmark detection). However, these methods require large-scale accurately annotated data. Unfortunately, it is challenging to get precise annotations of breast masses. To address this issue, we propose a fully convolutional network (FCN) based heatmap regression method for breast mass detection, using only weakly annotated mass regions in mammography images. Specifically, we first generate heat maps of masses based on human-annotated rough regions for breast masses. We then develop an FCN model for end-to-end heatmap regression with an F-score loss function, where the mammography images are regarded as the input and heatmaps for breast masses are used as the output. Finally, the probability map of mass locations can be estimated with the trained model. Experimental results on a mammography dataset with 439 subjects demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we evaluate whether we can use mammography data to improve detection models for DBT, since mammography shares similar structure with tomosynthesis. We propose a transfer learning strategy by fine-tuning the learned FCN model from mammography images. We test this approach on a small tomosynthesis dataset with only 40 subjects, and we show an improvement in the detection performance as compared to training the model from scratch.", "publication_location": "Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging   Proceedings of Spie", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2295443", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Discrepancy between training and testing domains is a fundamental problem in the generalization of machine learning techniques. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to learn domain invariant feature representations through adversarial deep learning. However, label shift, where the percentage of data in each class is different between domains, has received less attention. Label shift naturally arises in many contexts, especially in behavioral studies where the behaviors are freely chosen. In this work, we propose a method called Domain Adversarial nets for Target Shift (DATS) to address label shift while learning a domain invariant representation. This is accomplished by using distribution matching to estimate label proportions in a blind test set. We extend this framework to handle multiple domains by developing a scheme to upweight source domains most similar to the target domain. Empirical results show that this framework performs well under large label shift in synthetic and real experiments, demonstrating the practical importance.", "publication_location": "Aistats 2019   22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics", "link": null, "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

To enable training of the complex network with millions of learnable parameters using limited annotated data, we propose to first pre-train on auxiliary labels created from existing segmentation software.

With this learning strategy, we are able to use large neuroimaging repositories without manual annotations for training. In an extensive set of evaluations on eight datasets that cover a wide age range, pathology, and different scanners, we demonstrate that QuickNAT achieves superior segmentation accuracy and reliability in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, while being orders of magnitude faster.

Breast tumor segmentation based on dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) remains an active as well as a challenging problem. Previous studies often rely on manual annotation for tumor regions, which is not only time-consuming but also error-prone. Recent studies have shown high promise of deep learning-based methods in various segmentation problems. However, these methods are usually faced with the challenge of limited number (e.g., tens or hundreds) of medical images for training, leading to sub-optimal segmentation performance. Also, previous methods cannot efficiently deal with prevalent class-imbalance problems in tumor segmentation, where the number of voxels in tumor regions is much lower than that in the background area. To address these issues, in this study, we propose a mask-guided hierarchical learning (MHL) framework for breast tumor segmentation via fully convolutional networks (FCN). Our strategy is first decomposing the original difficult problem into several sub-problems and then solving these relatively simpler sub-problems in a hierarchical manner. To precisely identify locations of tumors that underwent a biopsy, we further propose an FCN model to detect two landmarks defined on nipples. Finally, based on both segmentation probability maps and our identified landmarks, we proposed to select biopsied tumors from all detected tumors via a tumor selection strategy using the pathology location. We validate our MHL method using data for 272 patients, and achieve a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.72 in breast tumor segmentation. Finally, in a radiogenomic analysis, we show that a previously developed image features show a comparable performance for identifying luminal A subtype when applied to the automatic segmentation and a semi-manual segmentation demonstrating a high promise for fully automated radiogenomic analysis in breast cancer.", "publication_location": "Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging   Proceedings of Spie", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2295436", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Given an error one is willing to tolerate, an important question is whether it is possible to modify the original iterations to obtain faster convergence to a minimizer achieving the allowed error without increasing the computational cost of each iteration considerably. Relying on recent recovery techniques developed for settings in which the desired signal belongs to some low-dimensional set, we show that using a coarse estimate of this set may lead to faster convergence at the cost of an additional reconstruction error related to the accuracy of the set approximation. Our theory ties to recent advances in sparse recovery, compressed sensing, and deep learning.

Recent Findings: Changes in technology and clinical breast cancer screening patterns have impacted the imaging evaluation of DCIS. DCIS classically presents as asymptomatic calcifications in women undergoing screening mammography. The replacement of traditional 2D mammography with digital breast tomosynthesis has changed the typical appearance of screen-detected DCIS. Ultrasound is traditionally utilized to detect DCIS in women with clinical symptoms, but efforts to increase screening ultrasound rates for women with dense breasts makes it more important to identify the appearance of DCIS in asymptomatic women. Improvements in MRI technology have made MRI the most sensitive imaging modality to detect DCIS and define the extent of disease, which is increasingly important given greater utilization of MRI for high-risk screening and determination of extent of known disease. Finally, the emergence of active surveillance, or non-surgical management, for DCIS has increased the focus on presurgical identification of associated invasive cancer, with early results demonstrating promise via computer vision and deep learning approaches for this task.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a RIS/PACS (Radiology Information System/Picture Archiving and Communication System) search engine, we obtained 100 consecutive abdominal CTs with at least one of the following findings: free-gas, free-fluid, or fat-stranding and 100 control cases with absence of these findings. The CT data were analyzed using a convolutional neural network algorithm previously trained for detection of these findings on an independent sample. The validation of the results was performed on a Web-based feedback system by a radiologist with 1 year of experience in abdominal imaging without prior knowledge of image findings through both visual confirmation and comparison with the clinically approved, written report as the standard of reference. All cases were included in the final analysis, except those in which the whole dataset could not be processed by the detection software. Measures of diagnostic accuracy were then calculated.

QBiC-Pred uses regression models of TF binding specificity trained on high-throughput in vitro data. The training is done using ordinary least squares (OLS), and we leverage distributional results associated with OLS estimation to compute, for each predicted change in TF binding, a P-value reflecting our confidence in the predicted effect. We show that OLS models are accurate in predicting the effects of mutations on TF binding in vitro and in vivo, outperforming widely-used PWM models as well as recently developed deep learning models of specificity. QBiC-Pred takes as input mutation datasets in several formats, and it allows post-processing of the results through a user-friendly web interface.

The design of on-demand graphene-based metamaterials often calls for the solution of a complex inverse problem within a small sampling space, which highly depends on the rich experiences from researchers of nanophotonics. Conventional optimization algorithms could be used for this inverse design, but they converge to local optimal solutions and take significant computational costs with increased nanostructure parameters. Here, we establish a deep learning method based on an adaptive batch-normalized neural network, aiming to implement smart and rapid inverse design for graphene-based metamaterials with on-demand optical responses.

Our goal is to investigate using only case-level labels extracted automatically from radiology reports to construct a multi-disease classifier for CT scans with deep learning method. We chose four lung diseases as a start: atelectasis, pulmonary edema, nodule and pneumonia. From a dataset of approximately 5,000 chest CT cases from our institution, we used a rule-based model to analyze those radiologist reports, labeling disease by text mining to identify cases with those diseases. From those results, we randomly selected the following mix of cases: 275 normal, 170 atelectasis, 175 nodule, 195 pulmonary edema, and 208 pneumonia. As a key feature of this study, each chest CT scan was represented by only 10 axial slices (taken at regular intervals through the lungs), and furthermore all slices shared the same label based on the radiology report. So the label was weak, because often disease will not appear in all slices. We used ResNet-50 as our classification model, with 4-fold cross-validation. Each slice was analyzed separately to yield a slice-level performance. For each case, we chose the 5 slices with highest probability and used their mean probability as the final patient-level probability. Performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC). For the 4 diseases separately, the slice-based AUCs were 0.71 for nodule, 0.79 for atelectasis, 0.96 for edema, and 0.90 for pneumonia. The patient-based AUC were 0.74 for nodule, 0.83 for atelectasis, 0.97 for edema, and 0.91 for pneumonia.

Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. Small animal imaging is essential in building a bridge from basic science to the clinic by providing the confidence necessary to move new cancer therapies to patients. However, there is considerable variability in preclinical imaging, including tumor volume estimations based on tumor segmentation procedures which can be clearly user-biased. Our group is engaged in developing quantitative imaging methods which will be applied in the preclinical arm of a co-clinical trial studying synergy between anti-PD-1 treatment and radiotherapy using a genetically engineered mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma. This study focuses on a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for automatic tumor segmentation based on multimodal MRI images, i.e. T1 weighted, T2 weighted and T1 weighted with contrast agent. Our images were acquired on a 7.0 T Bruker Biospec small animal MRI scanner. Preliminary results show that our U-net structure and 3D patch-wise approach using both Dice and cross entropy loss functions delivers strong segmentation results. We have also compared single performance using only T2 weighted versus multimodal MR images for CNN segmentation. Our results showthat Dice similarity coefficient were higher when using multimodal versus single T2 weighted data (0.84 Â± 0.05 and 0.81 Â± 0.03). In conclusion, we successfully established a segmentation method for preclinical MR sarcoma data based on deep learning.

With the dramatic shrink of feature size and the advance of semiconductor technology nodes, numerous and complicated design rules need to be followed, and a chip design can only be taped-out after passing design rule check (DRC).

In addition, a modern large-scaled design typically consists of many huge macros due to the wide use of intellectual properties (IPs). Empirically, the placement of these macros greatly determines routability, while there exists no effective cost metric to directly evaluate a macro placement because of the extremely high complexity and unpredictability of cell placement and routing. In this paper, we propose the first work of routability-driven macro placement with deep learning.

Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a relatively new modality for breast imaging that can provide detailed assessment of dense tissue within the breast. In the domains of cancer diagnosis, radiogenomics, and resident education, it is important to accurately segment breast masses. However, breast mass segmentation is a very challenging task, since mass regions have low contrast difference between their neighboring tissues. Notably, the task might become more difficult in cases that were assigned BI-RADS 0 category since this category includes many lesions that are of low conspicuity and locations that were deemed to be overlapping normal tissue upon further imaging and were not sent to biopsy. Segmentation of such lesions is of particular importance in the domain of reader performance analysis and education. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based method for segmentation of BI-RADS 0 lesions in DBT. The key components of our framework are an encoding path for local-to-global feature extraction, and a decoding patch to expand the images. To address the issue of limited training data, in the training stage, we propose to sample patches not only in mass regions but also in non-mass regions. We utilize a Dice-like loss function in the proposed network to alleviate the class-imbalance problem. The preliminary results on 40 subjects show promise of our method.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A DLA using a convolutional neural network was developed for automated detection of vision-threatening referable DR (preproliferative DR or worse, diabetic macular edema, or both). The DLA was tested by using a set of 106,244 nonstereoscopic retinal images. A panel of ophthalmologists graded DR severity in retinal photographs included in the development and internal validation data sets (n = 71,043); a reference standard grading was assigned once three graders achieved consistent grading outcomes. For external validation, we tested our DLA using 35,201 images of 14,520 eyes (904 eyes with any DR; 401 eyes with vision-threatening referable DR) from population-based cohorts of Malays, Caucasian Australians, and Indigenous Australians. RESULTS: Among the 71,043 retinal images in the training and validation data sets, 12,329 showed vision-threatening referable DR. In the internal validation data set, the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of the DLA for vision-threatening referable DR were 0.989, 97.0%, and 91.4%, respectively. Testing against the independent, multiethnic data set achieved an AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.955, 92.5%, and 98.5%, respectively. Among false-positive cases, 85.6% were due to a misclassification of mild or moderate DR. Undetected intraretinal microvascular abnormalities accounted for 77.3% of all false-negative cases.

MJ-CNN contains three models at multi-scale levels for a coarse-to-fine DIR to avoid being trapped in a local minimum. It is trained based on image similarity and deformation vector field (DVF) smoothness, requiring no supervision of ground-truth DVF. The three models are first trained sequentially and separately for their own registration tasks, and then are trained jointly for an end-to-end optimization under the multi-scale framework. In this study, MJ-CNN was trained using public SPARE 4D-CT data. The trained MJ-CNN was then evaluated on public DIR-LAB 4D-CT dataset as well as clinical CT-to-CBCT and CBCT-to-CBCT registration. For 4D-CT inter-phase registration, MJ-CNN achieved comparable accuracy to conventional iteration optimization-based methods, and showed the smallest registration errors compared to recently published deep learning-based DIR methods, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed multi-scale joint training scheme. Besides, MJ-CNN trained using one dataset (SPARE) could generalize to a different dataset (DIR-LAB) acquired by different scanners and imaging protocols. Furthermore, MJ-CNN trained on 4D-CTs also performed well on CT-to-CBCT and CBCT-to-CBCT registration without any re-training or fine-tuning, demonstrating MJ-CNN's robustness against applications and imaging techniques.

We introduce a deep learning framework, MimickNet, that transforms conventional delay-and-summed (DAS) beamformed images into the approximate post-processed images found on clinical-grade scanners. Training MimickNet only requires post-processed image samples from a scanner of interest without the need for explicit pairing to DAS data. Unpaired image flexibility allows MimckNet to hypothetically approximate any manufacturer's post-processing without hacking into commercial machines for pre-processed data. MimickNet generates images with an average similarity index measurement (SSIM) of 0.930Â±0.0892 on a 300 cineloop test set, and it generalizes to cardiac cineloops achieving an SSIM of 0.967Â±0.002 despite using no cardiac data in the training process.

Purpose: To determine whether domain transfer learning can improve the performance of deep features extracted from digital mammograms using a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) in the prediction of occult invasive disease for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) on core needle biopsy. Method: In this study, we collected digital mammography magnification views for 140 patients with DCIS at biopsy, 35 of which were subsequently upstaged to invasive cancer. We utilized a deep CNN model that was pre-trained on two natural image data sets (ImageNet and DTD) and one mammographic data set (INbreast) as the feature extractor, hypothesizing that these data sets are increasingly more similar to our target task and will lead to better representations of deep features to describe DCIS lesions. Through a statistical pooling strategy, three sets of deep features were extracted using the CNNs at different levels of convolutional layers from the lesion areas. A logistic regression classifier was then trained to predict which tumors contain occult invasive disease. The generalization performance was assessed and compared using repeated random sub-sampling validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Result: The best performance of deep features was from CNN model pre-trained on INbreast, and the proposed classifier using this set of deep features was able to achieve a median classification performance of ROC-AUC equal to 0.75, which is significantly better (p<=0.05) than the performance of deep features extracted using ImageNet data set (ROCAUC = 0.68).

Parkinson's disease (PD) currently Influences around one million people in the US. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical treatment for the motor symptoms of PD that delivers electrical stimulation to the basal ganglia (BG) region of the brain. Existing commercial DBS devices employ stimulation based only on fixed-frequency periodic pulses. While such periodic high-frequency DBS controllers provide effective relief of PD symptoms, they are very inefficient in terms of energy consumption, and the lifetime of these battery- operated devices is limited to 4 years. Furthermore, fixed high- frequency stimulation may have side effects, such as speech impairment. Consequently, there is a need to move beyond (1) fixed stimulation pulse controllers, and (2) 'one-size-fits- all' patient-agnostic treatments, to provide energy efficient and effective (in terms of relieving PD symptoms) DBS controllers. In this work, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (RL)- based approach that can derive patient-specific DBS patterns that are both effective in reducing a model-based proxy for PD symptoms, as well as energy-efficient. Specifically, we model the BG regions as a Markov decision process (MDP), and define the state and action space as state of the neurons in the BG regions and the stimulation patterns, respectively. Thereafter, we define the reward functions over the state space, and the learning objective is set to maximize the accumulated reward over a finite horizon (i.e., the treatment duration), while bounding average stimulation frequency. We evaluate the performance of our methodology using a Brain-on-Chip (BoC) FPGA platform that implements the physiologically-relevant basal ganglia model (BGM). We show that our RL-based DBS controllers significantly outperform existing fixed frequency controllers in terms of energy efficiency (e.g., by using 70% less energy than common periodic controllers), while providing suitable reduction of model-based proxy for PD symptoms.", "publication_location": "Proceedings   2020 Acm/Ieee 11th International Conference on Cyber Physical Systems, Iccps 2020", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCPS48487.2020.00018", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Typical deep RL approaches use a linear output layer, which means that deep RL can be interpreted as a feature construction/encoding network followed by linear value function approximation. This paper develops and evaluates a theory of linear feature encoding. We extend theoretical results on feature quality for linear value function approximation from the uncontrolled case to the controlled case.

Electronic Health Record (EHR) phenotyping utilizes patient data captured through normal medical practice, to identify features that may represent computational medical phenotypes. These features may be used to identify at-risk patients and improve prediction of patient morbidity and mortality. We present a novel deep multi-modality architecture for EHR analysis (applicable to joint analysis of multiple forms of EHR data), based on Poisson Factor Analysis (PFA) modules. Each modality, composed of observed counts, is represented as a Poisson distribution, parameterized in terms of hidden binary units. Information from different modalities is shared via a deep hierarchy of common hidden units. Activation of these binary units occurs with probability characterized as Bernoulli-Poisson link functions, instead of more traditional logistic link functions. In addition, we demonstrate that PFA modules can be adapted to discriminative modalities. To compute model parameters, we derive efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference that scales efficiently, with significant computational gains when compared to related models based on logistic link functions. To explore the utility of these models, we apply them to a subset of patients from the Duke-Durham patient cohort. We identified a cohort of over 16,000 patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) based on diagnosis codes and laboratory tests out of our patient population of over 240,000.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively obtained 462 multiphasic CT datasets with six series for each patient: three different contrast phases and two slice thickness reconstructions (1.5/5âmm), totaling 2772 series. AI-based liver volumes were determined using multi-scale deep-reinforcement learning for 3D body markers detection and 3D structure segmentation. The algorithm was trained for liver volumetry on approximately 5000 datasets. We computed the absolute error of each automatically- and manually-derived volume relative to the mean manual volume. The mean processing time/dataset and method was recorded. Variations of liver volumes were compared using univariate generalized linear model analyses. A subgroup of 60 datasets was manually segmented by three radiologists, with a further subgroup of 20 segmented three times by each, to compare the automatically-derived results with the ground-truth. RESULTS: The mean absolute error of the automatically-derived measurement was 44.3âmL (representing 2.37 % of the averaged liver volumes). The liver volume was neither dependent on the contrast phase (pâ=â0.697), nor on the slice thickness (pâ=â0.446). The mean processing time/dataset with the algorithm was 9.94âs (sec) compared to manual segmentation with 219.34âs.

While accurate localization of the STN is critical for consistent across-patients effective DBS, clear visualization of the STN under standard clinical MR protocols is still challenging. Therefore, intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MER) are incorporated to accurately localize the STN. However, MER require significant neurosurgical expertise and lengthen the surgery time. Recent advances in 7 T MR technology facilitate the ability to clearly visualize the STN. The vast majority of centers, however, still do not have 7 T MRI systems, and fewer have the ability to collect and analyze the data. This work introduces an automatic STN localization framework based on standard clinical MRIs without additional cost in the current DBS planning protocol. Our approach benefits from a large database of 7 T MRI and its clinical MRI pairs. We first model in the 7 T database, using efficient machine learning algorithms, the spatial and geometric dependency between the STN and its adjacent structures (predictors). Given a standard clinical MRI, our method automatically computes the predictors and uses the learned information to predict the patient-specific STN. We validate our proposed method on clinical T2 W MRI of 80 subjects, comparing with experts-segmented STNs from the corresponding 7 T MRI pairs.

However, the irregular distribution of zero weights in DNNs makes it difficult for resistive accelerators to take advantage of the sparsity as expected efficiently, because of its high reliance on regular matrix-vector multiplication in ReRAM.

Detection and localization of microcalcification (MC) clusters are very important in mammography diagnosis. Supervised MC detectors require learning from extracted individual MCs and MC clusters. However, they are limited by number of datasets given that MC images are hard to obtain. In this work, we propose a method to detect malignant microcalcification (MC) clusters using unsupervised, one-class, deep convolutional autoencoder. Specifically, we designed a deep autoencoder model where only patches extracted from normal cases' mammograms are used during training. We then applied our trained model on patches extracted from testing images. Our training dataset contains 408 normal subjects, including 1961 full-field digital mammography images. Our testing datasets contains 276 subjects. Specifically, 106 of them were patients diagnosed with Ductal Carcinoma In-Situ (DCIS); 70 of them were diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC); the rest 100 are normal cases containing 484 negative screening mammograms. Patches extracted from DCIS and IDC cases (positive patches) contain MC clusters, whereas patches extracted from normal cases (negative patches) don't. As the model is trained only on negative images that do not contain MCs, it cannot reconstruct MCs well, and thus, the reconstruction error will be larger on positive patches than negative patches. Our detection algorithm's decision is made based on Max-Squared Error between autoencoder's input and output patches. To confirm the results were not simply due to blurring, we then compared our designed detector with unsharp mask with Gaussian blur results. The results using the unsupervised autoencoder on testing patches with size 64Ã64 achieves an AUC result of 0.93.

In this paper, we challenge this assumption and show how to carefully design multi-step approaches that provide better performance-complexity trade-offs than their few-step counterparts. We consider the recently proposed learned digital backpropagation (LDBP) approach, where the linear steps in the split-step method are re-interpreted as general linear functions, similar to the weight matrices in a deep neural network. Our main contribution lies in an experimental demonstration of this approach for a 25 Gbaud single-channel optical transmission system. It is shown how LDBP can be integrated into a coherent receiver DSP chain and successfully trained in the presence of various hardware impairments. Our results show that LDBP with limited complexity can achieve better performance than standard DBP by using very short, but jointly optimized, finite-impulse response filters in each step.

The literature also demonstrates a learning curve among surgeons adopting TAA. The purpose of this study is to better define this learning curve for surgeons using third-generation implants. METHODS: Charts and radiographs were reviewed for the initial 26 TAA procedures performed by the senior author. Three third-generation implants were used: SBi (Small Bone Innovations) STAR, Salto Talaris, and Wright Medical INBONE. We report perioperative and early postoperative complications. RESULTS: Two perioperative fractures occurred in the first 9 cases, and the incidence subsequently dropped to 0 (P = .0431). Two cases of component malalignment occurred in the first 3 patients receiving the STAR implant, and the incidence then dropped to 0 (P = .0034). Five wound complications (4 minor and 1 major) occurred, all in the final 14 patients. No cases of nerve injury, tendon laceration, or deep vein thrombosis occurred. Two patients returned to the operating room as a result of complications, and the total perioperative and early postoperative complication rate was 27%. CONCLUSION: The observed rate of perioperative and early postoperative complications in this case series was low relative to other similar-sized studies, suggesting that third-generation implants can reduce adverse events. Our results demonstrate that some common complications could be avoided altogether (nerve/tendon injuries), some decreased quickly with experience (intraoperative fractures and component malpositioning), and some persisted unchanged throughout this study (wound complications).

Thus, the strategies educators use to convey occupation to students and the perspectives embedded in those strategies are critical topics for researchers. OBJECTIVE: To generalize findings from a previous qualitative study of how educators in 25 U.S. occupational therapy assistant and occupational therapy programs addressed occupation to a national sample of educators. DESIGN: As part of an exploratory sequential design, a national survey of U.S. occupational therapy and occupational therapy assistant educators explored activities and strategies used to teach occupation. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. SETTING: An online survey about educators' practices in the academic education setting. PARTICIPANTS: Occupational therapy and occupational therapy assistant educators (N = 1,590) from all programs in the United States. Of these, 634 returned surveys, 315 of which were complete and included in the analysis, for an overall response rate of 19.8%. RESULTS: Respondents identified similar learning activities and instructional strategies as those identified in the qualitative phase of the design. Most instruction was active and experiential, requiring students to integrate various skills and content areas. Definitions of occupation, as a basis for teaching, varied. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The combined survey and qualitative results offered initial empirical support for occupational therapy's proposed signature pedagogies and the importance of attending to the deep and implicit structures within those pedagogies. Such structures are believed to support students' formation of a professional identity and an occupational perspective.

Eighty-two percent of anesthesiology residents (n = 57 responders) at our institution had a \"high\" or \"very high\" concern about the level of ionizing radiation exposure, and 94% indicated interest in educational materials about radiation safety. This article highlights key learning points related to basic physical principles, effects of ionizing radiation, radiation exposure measurement, occupational dose limits, considerations during pregnancy, sources of exposure, factors affecting occupational exposure such as positioning and shielding, and monitoring. The principle source of exposure is through scattered radiation as opposed to direct exposure from the X-ray beam, with the patient serving as the primary source of scatter. As a result, maximizing the distance between the provider and the patient is of great importance to minimize occupational exposure. Our dosimeter monitoring project found that anesthesiology residents (n = 41) had low overall mean measured occupational radiation exposure.

Detecting an anomaly such as a malignant tumor or a nodule from medical images including mammogram, CT or PET images is still an ongoing research problem drawing a lot of attention with applications in medical diagnosis. A conventional way to address this is to learn a discriminative model using training datasets of negative and positive samples. The learned model can be used to classify a testing sample into a positive or negative class. However, in medical applications, the high unbalance between negative and positive samples poses a difficulty for learning algorithms, as they will be biased towards the majority group, i.e., the negative one. To address this imbalanced data issue as well as leverage the huge amount of negative samples, i.e., normal medical images, we propose to learn an unsupervised model to characterize the negative class. To make the learned model more flexible and extendable for medical images of different scales, we have designed an autoencoder based on a deep neural network to characterize the negative patches decomposed from large medical images. A testing image is decomposed into patches and then fed into the learned autoencoder to reconstruct these patches themselves. The reconstruction error of one patch is used to classify this patch into a binary class, i.e., a positive or a negative one, leading to a one-class classifier. The positive patches highlight the suspicious areas containing anomalies in a large medical image. The proposed method has been tested on InBreast dataset and achieves an AUC of 0.84. The main contribution of our work can be summarized as follows. 1) The proposed one-class learning requires only data from one class, i.e., the negative data; 2) The patch-based learning makes the proposed method scalable to images of different sizes and helps avoid the large scale problem for medical images; 3) The training of the proposed deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) based auto-encoder is fast and stable.", "publication_location": "Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging   Proceedings of Spie", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2293408", "citations": "9", "readership": "27", "tweets": "3", "news_mentions": " "},
{"title": "Improved survival of patients undergoing palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome: lessons learned from 115 consecutive patients.", "authors": " ", "published_date": "September 2002", "doi": " ", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Outcome of stage 1 palliation (S1P) for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) has improved coincident with application of treatment strategies including continuous superior vena cava oximetry (SvO2), phenoxybenzamine (POB), strategies to minimize the duration of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) and efforts to ameliorate the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) using aprotinin and modified ultrafiltration. METHODS AND RESULTS: Analysis of a consecutive series of 115 patients undergoing S1P was done to identify the risk factors for mortality and the impact of new treatment strategies. For the current era, July 1996 to October 2001, hospital survival was 93% (75/81) compared with 53% (18/34) for the time period, January 1992 to June 1996, P<0.001. Survival to stage 2 palliation (S2P) was also significantly improved in the current era, 81% (66/81) versus 44% (15/34), P<0.01. Anti-inflammatory treatment strategies demonstrated improved survival by univariate analysis (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis identified continuous SvO2 monitoring as a factor favoring S1P survival (P=0.02) and use of POB as a factor favoring survival to S2P (P=0.003). In the current era shorter duration of DHCA was associated with improved survival to S2P (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Improved survival following S1P can be achieved with strategies that allow for early identification of decreased systemic output and the use of afterload reduction to stabilize systemic vascular resistance and therefore the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio. Strategies to ameliorate the inflammatory response to CPB may decrease the degree and duration of postoperative support. Strategies to minimize duration of DHCA may improve intermediate survival and merit additional studies.", "publication_location": "Circulation", "link": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/12354714", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

DESIGN: Ex-vivo. METHODS: Corneoscleral buttons from human donors were loaded onto an artificial anterior chamber connected to a column of balanced salt solution. A surgeon-in-training learned to perform DALK via the BB technique using swept-source microscope-integrated optical coherence tomography (SS-MIOCT) with heads-up display (HUD). DALK procedures were performed at 6 different IOPs (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 40 mm Hg; n = 6 per group) in a randomized fashion, with the surgeon-in-training masked to the pressure and guided by SS-MIOCT with HUD. For a subset of corneas within each pressure group, DALK was performed on matching donor tissue at a control IOP. BB diameter was recorded, and a diameter exceeding the trephine diameter was considered optimal. RESULTS: Wilcoxon rank sum test showed a difference in BB diameter among the different pressure groups (mean Â± SD of 7.75 Â± 1.60, 8.33 Â± 1.99, 10.9 Â± 0.92, 9.08 Â± 1.07, 6.67 Â± 3.33, and 3.42 Â± 3.77 mm in the 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 mm Hg groups, respectively; P = 0.0014). Per Tukey test, this difference was attributable to comparisons between the 40 mm Hg group and the 5, 10, 15, or 20 mm Hg groups (P = 0.04, 0.02, 0.0001, 0.004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this ex-vivo model of DALK, the BB technique guided by SS-MIOCT with HUD yielded bubbles of optimal diameters only at physiologic pressures (10â20 mm Hg). Extremely high IOP (40 mm Hg) resulted in BBs of significantly smaller diameter than BBs obtained at physiologic and low (5 mm Hg) IOPs.", "publication_location": "Asia Pacific Journal of Ophthalmology (Philadelphia, Pa.)", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.22608/APO.2017265", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The impact of softmax on the value function itself in reinforcement learning (RL) is often viewed as problematic because it leads to sub-optimal value (or Q) functions and interferes with the contraction properties of the Bellman operator. Surprisingly, despite these concerns, and independent of its effect on exploration, the softmax Bellman operator when combined with Deep Q-learning, leads to Q-functions with superior policies in practice, even outperforming its double Q-learning counterpart. To better understand how and why this occurs, wc revisit theoretical properties of the softmax Bellman operator, and prove that (i) it converges to the standard Bellman operator exponentially fast in the inverse temperature parameter, and (ii) the distance of its Q function from the optimal one can be bounded. These alone do not explain its superior performance, so we also show that the softmax operator can reduce the over-estimation error, which may give some insight into why a sub-optimal operator leads to better performance in the presence of value function approximation. A comparison among different Bellman operators is then presented, showing the trade-offs when selecting them.", "publication_location": "36th International Conference on Machine Learning, Icml 2019", "link": null, "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Modern health data science applications leverage abundant molecular and electronic health data; providing opportunities for machine learning to build statistical models to support clinical practice.

We also introduce a principled cost function to exploit in-formation from censored events (events that occur subsequent to the observation window).

In 2 studies, we assessed mind wandering using thought probes while participants performed the metronome response task (MRT), which required them to synchronize button presses with tones. Participants performed this task while sitting on a Wii Balance Board providing us with an index of fidgeting. Results of Study 1 demonstrate that relative to on-task periods, mind wandering is indeed accompanied by increases in fidgeting, as well as increased response variability in the MRT. In Study 2, we observed that only deep mind wandering was associated with increases in fidgeting, whereas task-related response variability increased even during mild mind wandering. We interpret these findings in the context of current theories of mind wandering and suggest that (a) mind wandering is associated with costs not only to primary-task performance but also to secondary-task goals (e.g., controlling extraneous movements) and (b) these costs may depend on the degree to which task-related executive control processes are disengaged during mind wandering (i.e., depth of mind wandering).", "publication_location": "Journal of Experimental Psychology.

In medicine, both ethical and monetary costs of incorrect predictions can be significant, and the complexity of the problems often necessitates increasingly complex models. Recent work has shown that changing just the random seed is enough for otherwise well-tuned deep neural networks to vary in their individual predicted probabilities. In light of this, we investigate the role of model uncertainty methods in the medical domain. Using RNN ensembles and various Bayesian RNNs, we show that population-level metrics, such as AUC-PR, AUC-ROC, log-likelihood, and calibration error, do not capture model uncertainty. Meanwhile, the presence of significant variability in patient-specific predictions and optimal decisions motivates the need for capturing model uncertainty. Understanding the uncertainty for individual patients is an area with clear clinical impact, such as determining when a model decision is likely to be brittle. We further show that RNNs with only Bayesian embeddings can be a more efficient way to capture model uncertainty compared to ensembles, and we analyze how model uncertainty is impacted across individual input features and patient subgroups.", "publication_location": "Acm Chil 2020   Proceedings of the 2020 Acm Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3368555.3384457", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Transfer ability and conceptual understanding were assessed using open-response items administered to 138 students in the United States. Based on the responses to these items, we identified particular patterns of surface and deep-level transfer and found that deep-level transfer was uncommon. Further, we found that deep-level transfer and conceptual understanding shared a small but significant relation; surface-level transfer was unrelated.

Population risk is always of primary interest in machine learning; however, learning algorithms only have access to the empirical risk. Even for applications with nonconvex nonsmooth losses (such as modern deep networks), the population risk is generally significantly more well-behaved from an optimization point of view than the empirical risk. In particular, sampling can create many spurious local minima. We consider a general framework which aims to optimize a smooth nonconvex function F (population risk) given only access to an approximation f (empirical risk) that is pointwise close to F (i.e., kF â fkâ â¤ Î½). Our objective is to find the -approximate local minima of the underlying function F while avoiding the shallow local minima-arising because of the tolerance Î½-which exist only in f. We propose a simple algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a smoothed version of f that is guaranteed to achieve our goal as long as Î½ â¤ O(1.5/d). We also provide an almost matching lower bound showing that our algorithm achieves optimal error tolerance Î½ among all algorithms making a polynomial number of queries of f.

Examination of the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response to a visual conditioning stimulus early in training revealed significant bilateral learning-related increases in the BOLD response in the anterior interpositus nucleus (IPA) and significant bilateral deactivation in hemispheric lobule VI (HVI) of the cerebellar cortex. Later in training, the BOLD response remained bilateral in the cortex and predominantly ipsilateral in the IPA.

In this case, a firm's optimal market intelligence strategy must trade off learning a little about a broad range of markets (a broad strategy) with gaining a very deep understanding of one or a few markets (a focused strategy). This trade-off is not present when data are scarce, an assumption made in most of the existing literature on optimal information search strategies. However, in data-rich environments, which are of increasing relevance given technology changes, we show a focused market intelligence strategy is always best when managers need to process a substantial amount of data before beginning to gain insights; i.e., there are increasing returns to attention. Interestingly, this focused strategy can also be best with decreasing returns to attention when (a) managers are sufficiently efficient in processing the available data and (b) managers have sufficiently strong initial priors on the unknown market parameters. We show a broad market intelligence strategy is only optimal when new data points are sufficiently redundant, i.e., when the learning rate is sufficiently decreasing with the allocation of more attention. Our results also indicate that advances in information technology can account for the pressure on firms to become more focused and that competition increases the likelihood of a focused strategy. Competition can lead to asymmetric outcomes where firms focus on different markets. Finally, we note that a focused market intelligence strategy, and thus an asymmetric allocation of attention, does not require a priori differences between firms, markets, or market-specific core capabilities. Consequently, a focused market intelligence strategy can result in marketspecific core competencies and produce firm differences from equivalent starting conditions.

However, these policies can be cumbersome to specify and implement, and may not generalize well to complex and unpredictable environmental conditions. We propose a method for generating adaptive policies to secure visual output in AR systems using deep reinforcement learning. This approach utilizes a local fog computing node, which runs training simulations to automatically learn an appropriate policy for filtering potentially malicious or distracting content produced by an application.

The joint posterior probability mass function of target class, features, and classification estimates is learned from labeled data, and recursively updated as additional images become available. Based on the learned joint probability mass function, the approach presented in this paper predicts the expected confidence level of future target classifications, prior to obtaining new images. The proposed approach is tested with a set of simulated sonar image data.

We can handle very many control variables, endogenous receipt of treatment, heterogeneous treatment effects, and function-valued outcomes. Our framework covers the special case of exogenous receipt of treatment, either conditional on controls or unconditionally as in randomized control trials. In the latter case, our approach produces efficient estimators and honest bands for (functional) average treatment effects (ATE) and quantile treatment effects (QTE). To make informative inference possible, we assume that key reduced-form predictive relationships are approximately sparse. This assumption allows the use of regularization and selection methods to estimate those relations, and we provide methods for post-regularization and post-selection inference that are uniformly valid (honest) across a wide range of models. We show that a key ingredient enabling honest inference is the use of orthogonal or doubly robust moment conditions in estimating certain reduced-form functional parameters. We illustrate the use of the proposed methods with an application to estimating the effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on accumulated assets. The results on program evaluation are obtained as a consequence of more general results on honest inference in a general moment-condition framework, which arises from structural equation models in econometrics. Here, too, the crucial ingredient is the use of orthogonal moment conditions, which can be constructed from the initial moment conditions. We provide results on honest inference for (function-valued) parameters within this general framework where any high-quality, machine learning methods (e.g., boosted trees, deep neural networks, random forest, and their aggregated and hybrid versions) can be used to learn the nonparametric/high-dimensional components of the model. These include a number of supporting auxiliary results that are of major independent interest: namely, we (1) prove uniform validity of a multiplier bootstrap, (2) offer a uniformly valid functional delta method, and (3) provide results for sparsity-based estimation of regression functions for function-valued outcomes.", "publication_location": "Econometrica", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA12723", "citations": "55", "readership": "237", "tweets": "11", "news_mentions": " "},

The subthalamic nucleus (STN) within the sub-cortical region of the Basal ganglia is a crucial targeting structure for Parkinson's Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Volumetric segmentation of such small and complex structure, which is elusive in clinical MRI protocols, is thereby a pre-requisite process for reliable DBS direct targeting. While direct visualization of the STN is facilitated with advanced ultrahigh-field MR imaging (7 Tesla), such high fields are not always clinically available. In this paper, we aim at the automatic prediction of the STN region on clinical low-field MRI, exploiting dependencies between the STN and its adjacent structures, learned from ultrahigh-field MRI. We present a framework based on a statistical shape model to learn such shape relationship on high quality MR data sets. This allows for an accurate prediction and visualization of the STN structure, given detectable predictors on the low-field MRI.

In every case, information flowing through the cerebellum passes through Purkinje neurons, which receive input from the two primary cerebellar afferents and generate continuous streams of action potentials that constitute the sole output from the cerebellar cortex to the deep nuclei. The tonic firing behaviour observed in Purkinje neurons in vivo is maintained in brain slices even when synaptic inputs are blocked, suggesting that Purkinje neuron activity relies to a significant extent on intrinsic conductances. Previous research has suggested that the interplay between Ca2+ currents and Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa channels) is important for Purkinje cell activity, but how many different KCa channel types are present and what each channel type contributes to cell behaviour remains unclear. In order to better understand the ionic mechanisms that control the behaviour of these neurons, we investigated the effects of different Ca2+ channel and KCa channel antagonists on Purkinje neurons in acute slices of rat cerebellum. Our data show that Ca2+ entering through P-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels activates both small-conductance (SK) and large-conductance (BK) KCa channels. SK channels play a role in setting the intrinsic firing frequency, while BK channels regulate action potential shape and may contribute to the unique climbing fibre response.", "publication_location": "The Journal of Physiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2002.027854", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

{"title": "From Neosentience to Recombinant Informatics, A Research Overview", "authors": "Seaman, W", "published_date": "2013", "doi": " ", "abstract": "An overview of Seamanâs research relevant to new forms of Computer Science, Technology and Application covers a number of different theoretical research areas and approaches including the examination of new (and historical) studies that seek to look holistically at particular relations at operation in the mind/brain/body/environment, functioning across different scales. Seaman is interested in what he calls a multi-perspective approach to knowledge production. He is deeply interested in the trajectory of research started in Cybernetics at the Biological Research Lab headed by Heinz von Foerster [1][2][3][4][5][6], yet points to work by Rashevsky [7] as an important precursor, along with McCulloch and Pitts[8]. Cyberneticist Gordon Pask is of particular interest because he also explored a range of pursuits form the sciences[9][10][11][12] to the arts [13] to architecture [14] and learning systems/conversation theory, and âteaching machinesâ[15]. Pask, like von Foerster was also interested in new forms of computation and dynamic interactivity. We can trace a lineage from studies in Cybernetics to the study of contemporary complex systems. From this broad research agenda Seaman seeks to work toward the creation of new computational systems and in particular, new approaches to transdisciplinary research that point at forms of computation in the body, and explore these through biomimetics and bio-abstraction. As a media researcher, Seaman seeks to bring his knowledge of computational media, and broad historical research drawn from multiple disciplinary fields, into dynamic relationality. Central to this broad set of studies has been the articulation with scientist Otto RÃ¶ssler, of a series of disparate research areas that might be enfolded in the creation of a new form of robotic leaning system, that again draws from biomimetics and bio-abstraction, discussed in their book â Neosentience | The Benevolence Engine.[16] This book provides a series of micro-chapters that let researchers explore a set of disparate foci in a non-linear manner. Seaman describes this approach as âRecombinant Informaticsâ[17] â the juxtaposition, combination and recombination of differing informational contexts in the service of insight production. Seamanâs broad theoretical research agenda focuses in part on entailment structures [18] and the deep study of multiple physical processes as they contribute to âcomputationâ in the body[19]; the long-term expansion of computational forms relevant to Neuroscienceâexploring the notion of creating an electrochemical computer inspired by biomimetics and bio-abstraction[20][21]; the development of a network of computers inspired by computation in the bodyâ The Engine of Engines; the bringing to light of relevant biologically related historical research that to some degree has been left out of the central discourses in multiple scientific disciplines and in computer scienceâ in particular work done at the Biological Computer Lab headed by Heintz von Foerster [22]. In order to deal with the complexity of these issues in a pragmatic manner Seaman along with Todd Berreth and Olivier Perriquet are working on the creation of a computational system to help facilitate this research and other disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary research relevant to Computer Science, Technology and Application, entitled the Insight Engine.[23] [24]", "publication_location": "Computer Science, Technology, and Application", "link": null, "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Although ultrasonography has been stigmatized as too operator dependent and necessitating a steep learning curve, it has been our experience that the modality is relatively straightforward. Surgeons are in a unique position to utilize this technology, as they have the firm grasp of anatomy that is essential to the interpretation of sonograms. Ultrasound provides real-time dynamic imaging in the office and in the operative setting that directly benefits our patients. Ultrasound images can assist the clinician in determining the exact pathologic process, including location of symptoms, assessment of concurrent pathology, response to treatment, and the planning and intraoperative assessment of tendinous pathology. The Achilles tendon is the largest superficially located tendon of the body and is ideally suited to ultrasound examination. Achilles tendon morphology is best visualized with a high-frequency linear transducer (5 to 10 MHz). After an appropriate history and physical is obtained, the patient is positioned prone with both lower extremities disrobed (Fig. 2.1). As with all tendons, images of the Achilles tendon should be obtained in two orthogonal planes. Longitudinal and transverse images should be obtained from the musculotendinous junction to the distal tendon insertion on the calcaneus. To obtain an orderly and reproducible examination, imaging begins directly over the area of pain or tenderness with the foot in the gravity neutral position. In general, transverse imaging is followed by longitudinal imaging. Because ultrasound is a dynamic imaging modality, movie clips of the examination can be saved in the patient's electronic record. After the static examination of the area of interest, the surgeon grasps the patient's foot, introducing passive dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. This is followed by visualization of the symptomatic area with active range of motion. Finally, a full examination of the tendon from its most distal insertion proximally to the myotendinous junction is performed. Obviously, examination may be extended to the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, depending on the clinical situation. The normal Achilles tendon, as shown in Figure 2.2, appears echogenic (bright) with an organized fibrillar ultrastructure. The paratenon envelops the tendon as a thin, echogenic tissue layer clearly distinct from the tendon under dynamic imaging. The sural nerve and accompanying lesser saphenous vein course from medial to lateral and proximally to distally along the tendon. The plantaris tendon runs along the medial side of the tendon distally. Deep to the Achilles tendon lies the bipennate muscle belly of the flexor hallucis longus. In most cases, a diagnosis can be made based on the two-dimensional (2D) real-time appearance of the tendon; an acutely ruptured Achilles tendon is clearly identified by a discontinuity of collagen fibrils separated by hypoechoic hematoma (Fig. 2.3). Chronic ruptures demonstrate attenuation of the tendon and echogenic fat herniating into the defect (Fig. 2.4). The calcification and tendinosis pathognomonic of insertional disease can be easily correlated with physical examination findings (Fig. 2.5). In insertional disease, the examiner may use the transducer to palpate and image the osseotendinous junction simultaneously. It should be stressed that all findings must be confirmed in two planes.

Competence in performing ERCP and the learning curve for achieving competence are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the number of supervised ERCPs that physicians must do to achieve procedural competence. Competence was defined as a 0.8 probability of successfully completing specific technical components of ERCP and an overall grading of competence as judged by the attending physician. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University training program for gastroenterologists. PARTICIPANTS: 17 gastroenterology fellows at various stages of training. MEASURES: Experienced therapeutic endoscopists prospectively graded gastroenterology fellows during 1796 consecutive ERCPs. Fellows were graded on their overall level of competence for the procedure and on specific technical components of ERCP. RESULTS: Grading data were available for 1450 ERCPs (81%). The number of ERCPs done before adequate skill was achieved was 160 for cholangiography, 140 for pancreatography, 160 for deep cannulation of the pancreatic duct, 120 for stone extraction, and 60 for stent insertion. Fellows achieved overall competence after completing 180 to 200 ERCPs. The predicted probability of overall competence was 0.8 after 137 ERCPs and 0.9 after 185 ERCPs. CONCLUSIONS: At least 180 ERCPs were required before these gastroenterology fellows could be considered competent in ERCP. This number is much greater than that previously recommended, and these findings have substantial implications for training guidelines and issues of competence and certification in ERCP. The methods used to define and evaluate competence in ERCP could also be used to assess competence in other medical procedures.", "publication_location": "Annals of Internal Medicine", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-125-12-199612150-00009", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Previous phylogenetic inference of birds has been limited to mitochondrial genomes or a few nuclear genes. Here, we apply deep brain transcriptome sequencing of nine bird species (several passerines, hummingbirds, dove, parrot, and emu), using next-generation sequencing technology to understand features of transcriptome evolution in birds and how this affects phylogenetic inference, and combine with data from two bird species using first generation technology. The phylogenomic data matrix comprises 1,995 genes and a total of 0.77 Mb of exonic sequence. First, we find an unexpected heterogeneity in the evolution of base composition among avian lineages. There is a pronounced increase in guanine + cytosine (GC) content in the third codon position in several independent lineages, with the strongest effect seen in passerines. Second, we evaluate the effect of GC content variation on phylogenetic reconstruction. We find important inconsistencies between the topologies obtained with or without taking GC variation into account, each supporting different conclusions of past studies and also influencing hypotheses on the evolution of the trait of vocal learning. Third, we demonstrate a link between GC content evolution and recombination rate and, focusing on the zebra finch lineage, find that recombination seems to drive GC content. Although we cannot reveal the causal relationships, this observation is consistent with the model of GC-biased gene conversion. Finally, we use this unparalleled amount of avian sequence data to study the rate of molecular evolution, calibrated by fossil evidence and augmented with data from alligator transcriptome sequencing. There is a 2- to 3-fold variation in substitution rate among lineages with passerines being the most rapidly evolving and ratites the slowest.

Recent studies have implicated the cerebellum in these disorders, with post-mortem studies in ASD patients showing cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) loss, and isolated cerebellar injury has been associated with a higher incidence of ASDs. However, the extent of cerebellar contribution to the pathogenesis of ASDs remains unclear. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder with high rates of comorbid ASDs that result from mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2, whose protein products dimerize and negatively regulate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. TSC is an intriguing model to investigate the cerebellar contribution to the underlying pathogenesis of ASDs, as recent studies in TSC patients demonstrate cerebellar pathology and correlate cerebellar pathology with increased ASD symptomatology. Functional imaging also shows that TSC patients with ASDs display hypermetabolism in deep cerebellar structures, compared to TSC patients without ASDs. However, the roles of Tsc1 and the sequelae of Tsc1 dysfunction in the cerebellum have not been investigated so far. Here we show that both heterozygous and homozygous loss of Tsc1 in mouse cerebellar PCs results in autistic-like behaviours, including abnormal social interaction, repetitive behaviour and vocalizations, in addition to decreased PC excitability. Treatment of mutant mice with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, prevented the pathological and behavioural deficits.
