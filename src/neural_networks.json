Autobiographical memory (AM) retrieval recruits a consistent pattern of activation that potentially comprises multiple neural networks. However, it is unclear how such large-scale neural networks interact and are modulated by properties of the memory retrieval process. In the present functional MRI (fMRI) study, we combined independent component analysis (ICA) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to understand the neural networks supporting AM retrieval. ICA revealed four task-related components consistent with the previous literature: 1) medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) network, associated with self-referential processes, 2) medial temporal lobe (MTL) network, associated with memory, 3) frontoparietal network, associated with strategic search, and 4) cingulooperculum network, associated with goal maintenance. DCM analysis revealed that the medial PFC network drove activation within the system, consistent with the importance of this network to AM retrieval. Additionally, memory accessibility and recollection uniquely altered connectivity between these neural networks. Recollection modulated the influence of the medial PFC on the MTL network during elaboration, suggesting that greater connectivity among subsystems of the default network supports greater re-experience. In contrast, memory accessibility modulated the influence of frontoparietal and MTL networks on the medial PFC network, suggesting that ease of retrieval involves greater fluency among the multiple networks contributing to AM. These results show the integration between neural networks supporting AM retrieval and the modulation of network connectivity by behavior.", "publication_location": " ", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.04.039", "citations": "90", "readership": "172", "tweets": "1", "news_mentions": " "},

High demand for computation resources severely hinders deployment of large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in resource constrained devices. In this work, we propose a Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) method to regularize the structures (i.e., filters, channels, filter shapes, and layer depth) of DNNs. SSL can: (1) learn a compact structure from a bigger DNN to reduce computation cost; (2) obtain a hardware-friendly structured sparsity of DNN to efficiently accelerate the DNN's evaluation. Experimental results show that SSL achieves on average 5.1× and 3.1× speedups of convolutional layer computation of AlexNet against CPU and GPU, respectively, with off-the-shelf libraries. These speedups are about twice speedups of non-structured sparsity; (3) regularize the DNN structure to improve classification accuracy. The results show that for CIFAR-10, regularization on layer depth reduces a 20-layer Deep Residual Network (ResNet) to 18 layers while improves the accuracy from 91.25% to 92.60%, which is still higher than that of original ResNet with 32 layers.

Very large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable successes in a large variety of computer vision tasks. However, the high computation intensity of DNNs makes it challenging to deploy these models on resource-limited systems. Some studies used low-rank approaches that approximate the filters by low-rank basis to accelerate the testing. Those works directly decomposed the pre-trained DNNs by Low-Rank Approximations (LRA). How to train DNNs toward lower-rank space for more efficient DNNs, however, remains as an open area. To solve the issue, in this work, we propose Force Regularization, which uses attractive forces to enforce filters so as to coordinate more weight information into lower-rank space1. We mathematically and empirically verify that after applying our technique, standard LRA methods can reconstruct filters using much lower basis and thus result in faster DNNs. The effectiveness of our approach is comprehensively evaluated in ResNets, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet. In AlexNet, for example, Force Regularization gains 2× speedup on modern GPU without accuracy loss and 4:05× speedup on CPU by paying small accuracy degradation. Moreover, Force Regularization better initializes the low-rank DNNs such that the fine-tuning can converge faster toward higher accuracy. The obtained lower-rank DNNs can be further sparsified, proving that Force Regularization can be integrated with state-of-the-art sparsity-based acceleration methods.", "publication_location": "Proceedings of the Ieee International Conference on Computer Vision", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.78", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and its variations such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), have become standard building blocks for learning online data of sequential nature in many research areas, including natural language processing and speech data analysis. In this paper, we present a new methodology to significantly reduce the number of parameters in RNNs while maintaining performance that is comparable or even better than classical RNNs. The new proposal, referred to as Restricted Recurrent Neural Network (RRNN), restricts the weight matrices corresponding to the input data and hidden states at each time step to share a large proportion of parameters. The new architecture can be regarded as a compression of its classical counterpart, but it does not require pre-training or sophisticated parameter fine-tuning, both of which are major issues in most existing compression techniques. Experiments on natural language modeling show that compared with its classical counterpart, the restricted recurrent architecture generally produces comparable results at about 50% compression rate.

The persistent elevated delay activities could be internal representations of features of the learned visual stimuli shown to the monkey during training. When uncorrelated stimuli are presented during training in a fixed sequence, these experiments display significant correlations between the internal representations. Recently a simple model of attractor neural network has reproduced quantitatively the measured correlations. An underlying assumption of the model is that the synaptic matrix formed during the training phase contains in its efficacies information about the contiguity of persistent stimuli in the training sequence. We present here a simple unsupervised learning dynamics that produces such a synaptic matrix if sequences of stimuli are repeatedly presented to the network at fixed order. The resulting matrix is then shown to convert temporal correlations during training into spatial correlations between attractors. The scenario is that, in the presence of selective delay activity, at the presentation of each stimulus, the activity distribution in the neural assembly contain information of both the current stimulus and the previous one (carried by the attractor). Thus the recurrent synaptic matrix can code not only for each of the stimuli presented to the network but also for their context. We combine the idea that for learning to be effective, synaptic modification should be stochastic, with the fact that attractors provide learnable information about two consecutive stimuli. We calculate explicitly the probability distribution of synaptic efficacies as a function of training protocol, that is, the order in which stimuli are presented to the network. We then solve for the dynamics of a network composed of integrate-and-fire excitatory and inhibitory neurons with a matrix of synaptic collaterals resulting from the learning dynamics. The network has a stable spontaneous activity, and stable delay activity develops after a critical learning stage. The availability of a learning dynamics makes possible a number of experimental predictions for the dependence of the delay activity distributions and the correlations between them, on the learning stage and the learning protocol. In particular it makes specific predictions for pair-associates delay experiments.", "publication_location": "Neural Computation", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/neco.1996.8.8.1677", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Since the TNM staging system was introduced in the 1950s, new prognostic factors have been identified and new methods for integrating prognostic factors have been developed. This study compares the prediction accuracy of the TNM staging system with that of artificial neural network statistical models. METHODS: For 5-year survival of patients with breast or colorectal carcinoma, the authors compared the TNM staging system's predictive accuracy with that of artificial neural networks (ANN). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, as applied to an independent validation data set, was the measure of accuracy. RESULTS: For the American College of Surgeons' Patient Care Evaluation (PCE) data set, using only the TNM variables (tumor size, number of positive regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis), the artificial neural network's predictions of the 5-year survival of patients with breast carcinoma were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.720; ANN, 0.770; P < 0.001). For the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results breast carcinoma data set, using only the TNM variables, the artificial neural network's predictions of 10-year survival were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.692; ANN, 0.730; P < 0.01). For the PCE colorectal data set, using only the TNM variables, the artificial neural network's predictions of the 5-year survival of patients with colorectal carcinoma were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.737; ANN, 0.815; P < 0.001). Adding commonly collected demographic and anatomic variables to the TNM variables further increased the accuracy of the artificial neural network's predictions of breast carcinoma survival (0.784) and colorectal carcinoma survival (0.869). CONCLUSIONS: Artificial neural networks are significantly more accurate than the TNM staging system when both use the TNM prognostic factors alone. New prognostic factors can be added to artificial neural networks to increase prognostic accuracy further.

Neural networks hold a critical domain in machine learning algorithms because of their self-adaptiveness and state-of-the-art performance. Before the testing (inference) phases in practical use, sophisticated training (learning) phases are required, calling for efficient training methods with higher accuracy and shorter converging time. Many existing studies focus on the training optimization on high-performance servers or computing clusters, e.g. GPU clusters. However, training neural networks on resource-constrained devices, e.g. mobile platforms, is an important research topic barely touched. In this paper, we implement AdaLearner-an adaptive distributed mobile learning system for neural networks that trains a single network with heterogenous mobile resources under the same local network in parallel.

Because of the known disconnection theory, geriatric depression could be a useful model in studying the interactions among different networks. In the present study, using independent component analysis to identify intrinsically connected neural networks, we investigated the alterations in synchronizations among neural networks in geriatric depression to better understand the underlying neural mechanisms. Resting-state fMRI data was collected from thirty-two patients with geriatric depression and thirty-two age-matched never-depressed controls. We compared the resting-state activities between the two groups in the default-mode, central executive, attention, salience, and affective networks as well as correlations among these networks. The depression group showed stronger activity than the controls in an affective network, specifically within the orbitofrontal region. However, unlike the never-depressed controls, geriatric depression group lacked synchronized/antisynchronized activity between the affective network and the other networks. Those depressed patients with lower executive function has greater synchronization between the salience network with the executive and affective networks.

In the present functional MRI study, we employed independent-component analysis to examine the influence of the engagement of neural networks during the recall of personal memories in a PTSD group (15 participants) as compared to non-trauma-exposed healthy controls (14 participants). We found that the PTSD group recruited similar neural networks when compared to the controls during AM recall, including default-network subsystems and control networks, but group differences emerged in the spatial and temporal characteristics of these networks. First, we found spatial differences in the contributions of the anterior and posterior midline across the networks, and of the amygdala in particular, for the medial temporal subsystem of the default network. Second, we found temporal differences within the medial prefrontal subsystem of the default network, with less temporal coupling of this network during AM retrieval in PTSD relative to controls.

The controller structure is that of a feedforward sigmoidal neural network that is both adaptive and reconfigurable, since the control law it approximates can be modified by updating its parameters during operation. The neural network controller is designed via LMIs to meet multiple control objectives, that include but are not limited to LQG and H∞ performance, pole placement, and closed-loop stability, as dictated by the application of interest. Prior knowledge of the linearized equations of motion is utilized in order to guarantee that the neural network controller meets these objectives when the aircraft is operating in its linear-parameter varying (LPV) regime, or steady-state flight envelope. However, should unexpected changes or failures occur during flight, the controller also is capable to reconfigure according to the new and, possibly, nonlinear dynamics. The adaptation consists of a constrained optimization problem that is computationally feasible because it takes place incrementally over time, accounting for the new dynamics only if and when they arise. The LPV performance of the controller is preserved and guaranteed throughout adaptation, by means of a novel constrained-training technique for neural networks.

In our study, we use three benchmark datasets of increasing complexity, MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, to investigate the effects of imbalance on classification and perform an extensive comparison of several methods to address the issue: oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding that compensates for prior class probabilities.

We also investigated the effects of image size on the discriminative ability and heatmap analysis to determine which parts of the image contribute to the discrimination. Additionally, we used 465 poor-quality images to investigate the effect of poor image quality on the discriminative ability. RESULTS: Three DCNNs showed areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.9 or more. The AUC of the DCNN using glaucoma-confirmed eyes against nonglaucomatous eyes was higher than that using glaucoma-suspected eyes against nonglaucomatous eyes by approximately 0.1.

However, its computational cost can be too high for many biochemical systems because of the large number of ab initio QM calculations. Semiempirical QM/MM simulations have much higher efficiency. Its accuracy can be improved with a correction to reach the ab initio QM/MM level. The computational cost on the ab initio calculation for the correction determines the efficiency. In this paper we developed a neural network method for QM/MM calculation as an extension of the neural-network representation reported by Behler and Parrinello. With this approach, the potential energy of any configuration along the reaction path for a given QM/MM system can be predicted at the ab initio QM/MM level based on the semiempirical QM/MM simulations. We further applied this method to three reactions in water to calculate the free energy changes. The free-energy profile obtained from the semiempirical QM/MM simulation is corrected to the ab initio QM/MM level with the potential energies predicted with the constructed neural network. The results are in excellent accordance with the reference data that are obtained from the ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics simulation or corrected with direct ab initio QM/MM potential energies. Compared with the correction using direct ab initio QM/MM potential energies, our method shows a speed-up of 1 or 2 orders of magnitude. It demonstrates that the neural network method combined with the semiempirical QM/MM calculation can be an efficient and reliable strategy for chemical reaction simulations.", "publication_location": "Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00663", "citations": "26", "readership": "134", "tweets": "7", "news_mentions": " "},

In order to address the problem of adaptive control in unknown environments, it is possible to utilize artificial neural networks to learn the characteristics of the system rather than having to prespecify an explicit system model. In this paper, two artificial-neural-network-based strategies are implemented for the accurate trajectory tracking by a SCARA-type IBM 7540 robot.

These high stress levels lead to a high risk of burnout. The objective was to assess whether artificial neural network (ANN) paradigms offer greater predictive accuracy than statistical methodologies, which are commonly used in the field of burnout. A radial basis function (RBF) network and hierarchical stepwise regression was used to assess burnout. The comparison of the two methodologies was carried out by analysing a sample of 462 nurses and student nurses. The subjects were from three hospitals in Madrid (Spain), who completed the 'Nursing Burnout Scale' survey. A RBF network was better suited for the analysis of burnout than hierarchical stepwise regression. The outcomes indicate furthermore that the relationship with the burnout process of the predictive variables age, job status, workload, experience with pain and death, conflictive interaction, role ambiguity and hardy personality is not entirely linear. The usage of ANNs in the field of burnout has been justified due to their superior ability to capture non-linear relationships, which is relevant for theory development. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: Due to the superior ability to capture non-linear relationships, ANNs are better suited to explain and predict burnout and its subdimensions than common statistical methods. From this perspective, more specific programmes to prevent burnout and its consequences in the workplace can be designed.", "publication_location": "Ergonomics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00140139.2010.502251", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Deep neural networks have proved very successful on archetypal tasks for which large training sets are available, but when the training data are scarce, their performance suffers from overfitting. Many existing methods of reducing overfitting are data-independent. Data-dependent regularizations are mostly motivated by the observation that data of interest lie close to a manifold, which is typically hard to parametrize explicitly. These methods usually only focus on the geometry of the input data, and do not necessarily encourage the networks to produce geometrically meaningful features. To resolve this, we propose the Low-Dimensional-Manifold-regularized neural Network (LDMNet), which incorporates a feature regularization method that focuses on the geometry of both the input data and the output features. In LDMNet, we regularize the network by encouraging the combination of the input data and the output features to sample a collection of low dimensional manifolds, which are searched efficiently without explicit parametrization. To achieve this, we directly use the manifold dimension as a regularization term in a variational functional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is a Laplace-Beltrami equation over a point cloud, which is solved by the point integral method without increasing the computational complexity. In the experiments, we show that LDMNet significantly outperforms widely-used regularizers. Moreover, LDMNet can extract common features of an object imaged via different modalities, which is very useful in real-world applications such as cross-spectral face recognition.", "publication_location": "Proceedings of the Ieee Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2018.00290", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing tasks is inspiring research efforts attempting to achieve similar success for geometric tasks. One of the main challenges in applying CNNs to surfaces is defining a natural convolution operator on surfaces. In this paper we present a method for applying deep learning to sphere-type shapes using a global seamless parameterization to a planar flat-torus, for which the convolution operator is well defined. As a result, the standard deep learning framework can be readily applied for learning semantic, highlevel properties of the shape. An indication of our success in bridging the gap between images and surfaces is the fact that our algorithm succeeds in learning semantic information from an input of raw low-dimensional feature vectors. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by presenting two applications: human body segmentation, and automatic landmark detection on anatomical surfaces.

Spectral CT can provide accurate tissue composition measurements by utilizing the energy dependence of x-ray attenuation in different materials. We have introduced image reconstruction and material decomposition algorithms for multi-energy CT data acquired either with energy integrating detectors (EID) or photon counting detectors (PCD); however, material decomposition is an ill-posed problem due to the potential overlap of spectral measurements and to noise. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have generated excitement in the field of machine learning and computer vision. The goal of this work is to develop CNN-based methods for material decomposition in spectral CT. The CNN for decomposition had a U-net structure and was trained with either five-energy PCD-CT or DE-CT. As targets for training, we used simulated phantoms constructed from random combinations of water and contrast agents (iodine, barium, and calcium for five-energy PCD-CT; iodine and gold for DE EID-based CT). The experimentally measured sensitivity matrix values for iodine, barium, and calcium or iodine and gold were used to recreate the CT images corresponding to both PCD and DE-CT cases. These CT images were used to train CNNs to generate material maps at each pixel location. After training, we tested the CNNs by applying them to experimentally acquired DE-EID and PCD-based micro-CT data in mice. The predicted material maps were compared to the absolute truth in simulations and to sensitivity-based decompositions for the in vivo mouse data.

Recent advances in memristor technology lead to the feasibility of large-scale neuromorphic systems by leveraging the similarity between memristor devices and synapses. For instance, memristor cross-point arrays can realize dense synapse network among hundreds of neuron circuits, which is not affordable for traditional implementations. However, little progress was made in synapse designs that support both static and dynamic synaptic properties. In addition, many neuron circuits require signals in specific pulse shape, limiting the scale of system implementation. Last but not least, a bottom-up study starting from realistic memristor devices is still missing in the current research of memristor-based neuromorphic systems. Here, we propose a memristor-based dynamic (MD) synapse design with experiment-calibrated memristor models. The structure obtains both static and dynamic synaptic properties by using one memristor for weight storage and the other as a selector. We overcame the device nonlinearities and demonstrated spike-timing-based recall, weight tunability, and spike-timing-based learning functions on MD synapse. Furthermore, a temporal pattern learning application was investigated to evaluate the use of MD synapses in spiking neural networks, under both spike-timing-dependent plasticity and remote supervised method learning rules.", "publication_location": "Ieee Transactions on Computer Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2016.2618866", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Neural networks have shown great performance in cognitive tasks. When deploying network models on mobile devices with limited computation and storage resources, the weight quantization technique has been widely adopted. In practice, 8-bit or 16-bit quantization is mostly likely to be selected in order to maintain the accuracy at the same level as the models in 32-bit floating-point precision. Binary quantization, on the contrary, aims to obtain the highest compression at the cost of much bigger accuracy drop. Applying different precision in different layers/structures can potentially produce the most efficient model. Seeking for the best precision configuration, however, is difficult. In this work, we proposed an automatic search algorithm to address the challenge. By relaxing the search space of quantization bitwidth from discrete to continuous domain, our algorithm can generate a mixed-precision quantization scheme which achieves the compression rate close to the one from the binary-weighted model while maintaining the testing accuracy similar to the original full-precision model.", "publication_location": "Proceedings 2019 Ieee International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Circuits and Systems, Aicas 2019", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/AICAS.2019.8771498", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

We formally prove that these networks with random Gaussian weights perform a distance-preserving embedding of the data, with a special treatment for in-class and out-of-class data. Similar points at the input of the network are likely to have a similar output. The theoretical analysis of deep networks here presented exploits tools used in the compressed sensing and dictionary learning literature, thereby making a formal connection between these important topics.

We demonstrate this functionality through pre-segmentation of input images with a fast and robust but loose segmentation step, to obtain a set of candidate objects. These objects then undergo a spatial transformation into a reduced space, retaining but a compact high-level representation of their appearance.

Stochastic blockmodels (SBM) and their variants, e.g., mixed-membership and overlapping stochastic blockmodels, are latent variable based generative models for graphs. They have proven to be successful for various tasks, such as discovering the community structure and link prediction on graph-structured data. Recently, graph neural networks, e.g., graph convolutional networks, have also emerged as a promising approach to learn powerful representations (embeddings) for the nodes in the graph, by exploiting graph properties such as locality and invariance. In this work, we unify these two directions by developing a sparse variational autoencoder for graphs, that retains the interpretability of SBMs, while also enjoying the excellent predictive performance of graph neural nets. Moreover, our framework is accompanied by a fast recognition model that enables fast inference of the node embeddings (which are of independent interest for inference in SBM and its variants). Although we develop this framework for a particular type of SBM, namely the overlapping stochastic blockmodel, the proposed framework can be adapted readily for other types of SBMs. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate encouraging results on link prediction while learning an interpretable latent structure that can be used for community discovery.", "publication_location": "36th International Conference on Machine Learning, Icml 2019", "link": null, "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Recent methods address this problem by using adaptive preconditioning for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). These methods improve convergence by adapting to the local geometry of parameter space. A second issue is overfitting, which is typically addressed by early stopping. However, recent work has demonstrated that Bayesian model averaging mitigates this problem. The posterior can be sampled by using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). However, the rapidly changing curvature renders default SGLD methods inefficient. Here, we propose combining adaptive preconditioners with SGLD.

These analyses revealed remarkable differences in network organization across the impulsivity spectrum. Specifically, in highly impulsive individuals, regulatory structures including medial and lateral regions of the prefrontal cortex were isolated from subcortical structures associated with appetitive drive, whereas these brain areas clustered together within the same module in less impulsive individuals. Further exploration of the modular organization of whole-brain networks revealed novel shifts in the functional connectivity between visual, sensorimotor, cortical, and subcortical structures across the impulsivity spectrum.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four diagnostic strategies were explored to help define the diagnostic role of neural networks in patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism in whom nondiagnostic ventilation-perfusion lung scans were obtained. First, a network was used to determine which patients could be directly referred for treatment without angiography. Second, the network was applied to determine in which patients treatment could be withheld. Third, the network was used to distinguish patients in whom the network gave indeterminate responses and who should proceed to angiography. Each strategy was compared with use of angiography in terms of morbidity, mortality, and cost per life saved. RESULTS: The use of the neural network reduced the average cost per patient by more than one-half relative to the cost of angiography. Morbidity and mortality rates were also comparable to or lower than those associated with angiography. The results were consistent regardless of the prevalence of disease.

This number is small enough such that the simulations can be completed in a short time frame but large enough to enable reliable training. The trained neural network can then be used to explore a much larger parametric space. We demonstrate this notion by training neural networks to predict pattern formation and stochastic gene expression.

Here, we show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-a machine learning approach that recently became the leading technique for object recognition, human pose estimation, and human action recognition-were able to recognize directly from images whether Drosophila were \"on\" (standing or walking) or \"off\" (not in physical contact with) egg-laying substrates for each frame of our videos.

We consider the two dynamical regimes exhibited by random neural networks: the weak-coupling regime, where the firing activity decays to a single fixed point unless the network is stimulated, and the strong-coupling or chaotic regime, characterized by internally generated fluctuating firing rates. In the weak-coupling regime, we compute analytically, for an arbitrary degree of symmetry, the autocorrelation of network activity in the presence of external noise.

A popular theoretical scenario for modeling memory function is the attractor neural network scenario, whose prototype is the Hopfield model. The model simplicity and the locality of the synaptic update rules come at the cost of a poor storage capacity, compared with the capacity achieved with perceptron learning algorithms. Here, by transforming the perceptron learning rule, we present an online learning rule for a recurrent neural network that achieves near-maximal storage capacity without an explicit supervisory error signal, relying only upon locally accessible information. The fully-connected network consists of excitatory binary neurons with plastic recurrent connections and non-plastic inhibitory feedback stabilizing the network dynamics; the memory patterns to be memorized are presented online as strong afferent currents, producing a bimodal distribution for the neuron synaptic inputs. Synapses corresponding to active inputs are modified as a function of the value of the local fields with respect to three thresholds. Above the highest threshold, and below the lowest threshold, no plasticity occurs. In between these two thresholds, potentiation/depression occurs when the local field is above/below an intermediate threshold. We simulated and analyzed a network of binary neurons implementing this rule and measured its storage capacity for different sizes of the basins of attraction. The storage capacity obtained through numerical simulations is shown to be close to the value predicted by analytical calculations. We also measured the dependence of capacity on the strength of external inputs. Finally, we quantified the statistics of the resulting synaptic connectivity matrix, and found that both the fraction of zero weight synapses and the degree of symmetry of the weight matrix increase with the number of stored patterns.", "publication_location": "Plos Computational Biology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004439", "citations": "12", "readership": "71", "tweets": "6", "news_mentions": " "},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 254 adult patients, 266 lesions that had been sampled at biopsy were randomly selected for the study. There were 96 malignant and 170 benign lesions. On the basis of nine mammographic findings and patient age, a three-layer backpropagation network was developed to predict whether the malignant lesions were in situ or invasive. RESULTS: The ANN predicted invasion among malignant lesions with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) of .91 +/- .03.

A number of retrieval approaches have been investigated, including empirical techniques, coupling with numerical weather prediction models, and data analysis techniques such as regression. In this paper, artificial neural networks are used to retrieve vertical temperature and dewpoint profiles from infrared and microwave brightness temperatures from a polar-orbiting satellite. This approach allows retrievals to be performed even in cloudy conditions-a limitation of infrared-only retrievals. In a direct comparison of this technique with results from the operational Advanced Television and Infrared Observation Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder (ATOVS) retrievals, it was found that the neural-network temperature retrievals had larger errors than the ATOVS retrievals (though generally smaller than the first guess used in the ATOVS retrievals) but that the dewpoint retrievals showed consistent improvement over the comparable ATOVS retrievals.", "publication_location": "Journal of Applied Meteorology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(2001)040<2051:CIMSRO>2.0.CO;2", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

All rights reserved. This paper presents a new approach for autonomous taxiing that can potentially improve the efficiency and safety of ground operations in commercial or military airports. Research on airport automation so far has focused primarily on scheduling and coordination of piloted aircraft for improved overall efficiency and lower operational costs. This paper develops a novel vision-guided path planning and control approach that could potentially lead to unmanned taxiing and takeoff. Autonomous taxing is a challenging problem because on-board perception algorithms must be capable of translating verbal commands provided by the Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower and, at the same time, react to a wide range of possible runway incursions, taxiway and runway conditions, and ground crew behaviors, in order to operate safely in complex airport environments without human intervention. In this paper, the autonomous taxiing problem is formulated as a hybrid planning and control problem that can be solved by an approach based on vision-based perception, obstacle avoidance, and feedback control theory. By harnessing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for computer vision, the information obtained by onboard cameras about surrounding environments can be integrated with prior information – such as airport maps – and ATC commands to compute motion plans, while simultaneously detecting and adapting to dangerous situations such as runway incursions. Simulation results obtained using the photo-realistic physics-based Unreal EngineT M simulation tool show that the proposed approach can be potentially used some day to automate airport ground operations, even in crowded environments populated with ground crew, vehicles, and other aircraft.", "publication_location": "Aiaa Scitech 2019 Forum", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2019-0928", "citations": "2", "readership": " ", "tweets": "1", "news_mentions": " "},

Improved performance in the discrimination of buried threats using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data has recently been achieved using features developed for applications in computer vision. These features, designed to characterize local shape information in images, have been utilized to recognize patches that contain a target signature in two-dimensional slices of GPR data. While these adapted features perform very well in this GPR application, they were not designed to specifically differentiate between target responses and background GPR data. One option for developing a feature specifically designed for target differentiation is to manually design a feature extractor based on the physics of GPR image formation. However, as seen in the historical progression of computer vision features, this is not a trivial task. Instead, this research evaluates the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to two-dimensional GPR data. The benefit of using a CNN is that features extracted from the data are a learned parameter of the system. This has allowed CNN implementations to achieve state of the art performance across a variety of data types, including visual images, without the need for expert designed features. However, the implementation of a CNN must be done carefully for each application as network parameters can cause performance to vary widely.

The computational cost of QM/MM calculations during MD simulations can be reduced significantly using semiempirical QM/MM methods with lower accuracy. To achieve higher accuracy at the ab initio QM/MM level, a correction on the existing semiempirical QM/MM model is an attractive idea. Recently, we reported a neural network (NN) method as QM/MM-NN to predict the potential energy difference between semiempirical and ab initio QM/MM approaches. The high-level results can be obtained using neural network based on semiempirical QM/MM MD simulations, but the lack of direct MD samplings at the ab initio QM/MM level is still a deficiency that limits the applications of QM/MM-NN. In the present paper, we developed a dynamic scheme of QM/MM-NN for direct MD simulations on the NN-predicted potential energy surface to approximate ab initio QM/MM MD. Since some configurations excluded from the database for NN training were encountered during simulations, which may cause some difficulties on MD samplings, an adaptive procedure inspired by the selection scheme reported by Behler [ Behler Int. J. Quantum Chem. 2015 , 115 , 1032 ; Behler Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2017 , 56 , 12828 ] was employed with some adaptions to update NN and carry out MD iteratively. We further applied the adaptive QM/MM-NN MD method to the free energy calculation and transition path optimization on chemical reactions in water. The results at the ab initio QM/MM level can be well reproduced using this method after 2-4 iteration cycles. The saving in computational cost is about 2 orders of magnitude. It demonstrates that the QM/MM-NN with direct MD simulations has great potentials not only for the calculation of thermodynamic properties but also for the characterization of reaction dynamics, which provides a useful tool to study chemical or biochemical systems in solution or enzymes.", "publication_location": "Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01195", "citations": "14", "readership": "86", "tweets": "15", "news_mentions": " "},

The ADMM updates consist of a proximity operator, a least squares regression that includes a big matrix inversion, and an explicit solution for updating the dual variables. Typically, inner loops are required to solve the first two sub-minimization problems due to the intractability of the prior and the matrix inversion. To avoid such drawbacks or limitations, we propose an inner-loop free update rule with two pre-trained deep convolutional architectures. More specifically, we learn a conditional denoising auto-encoder which imposes an implicit data-dependent prior/regularization on ground-truth in the first sub-minimization problem. This design follows an empirical Bayesian strategy, leading to so-called amortized inference. For matrix inversion in the second sub-problem, we learn a convolutional neural network to approximate the matrix inversion, i.e., the inverse mapping is learned by feeding the input through the learned forward network. Note that training this neural network does not require ground-truth or measurements, i.e., data-independent.

Mapping such diseases is greatly simplified if the data present a homogeneous genetic trait and if disease status can be reliably determined. Here, we present an approach to determination of disease status, using methods of artificial neural-network analysis. The method entails \"training\" an artificial neural network, with input facts (based on diagnostic criteria) and related results (based on disease diagnosis). The network contains weight factors connecting input \"neurons\" to output \"neurons,\" and these connections are adjusted until the network can reliably produce the appropriate outputs for the given input facts. The trained network can be \"tested\" with a second set of facts, in which the outcomes are known but not provided to the network, to see how well the training has worked. The method was applied to members of a pedigree with LGMD1A, now mapped to chromosome 5q. We used diagnostic criteria and disease status to train a neural network to classify individuals as \"affected\" or \"not affected.\" The trained network reproduced the disease diagnosis of all individuals of known phenotype, with 98% reliability.

This will increase the uncertainty of the system and affect the theoretical analysis. Also, neural network is considered as a typical nonlinear system. Therefore, the model studied in this paper is a nonlinear system with switching characteristics. In complex environments, MMNNs may receive mixed attacks, one of which is called cyber-physical attacks that may influence both communication links and MNN nodes to cause changes in topology and physical state. To tackle this issue, we construct a novel Lyapunov functional and use properties of M-matrix to get the criteria for synchronization of MMNNs under cyber-physical attacks.

This paper presents a novel constrained integration (CINT) method for solving initial boundary value partial differential equations (PDEs). The CINT method combines classical Galerkin methods with a constrained backpropogation training approach to obtain an artificial neural network representation of the PDE solution that approximately satisfies the boundary conditions at every integration step. The advantage of CINT over existing methods is that it is readily applicable to solving PDEs on irregular domains, and requires no special modification for domains with complex geometries. Furthermore, the CINT method provides a semi-analytical solution that is infinitely differentiable. In this paper the CINT method is demonstrated on two hyperbolic and one parabolic initial boundary value problems with a known analytical solutions that can be used for performance comparison. The numerical results show that, when compared to the most efficient finite element methods, the CINT method achieves significant improvements both in terms of computational time and accuracy.", "publication_location": "Neurocomputing", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2014.11.058", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Imaging phantoms are test patterns used to measure image quality in computer tomography (CT) systems. A new phantom platform (Mercury Phantom, Gammex) provides test patterns for estimating the task transfer function (TTF) or noise power spectrum (NPF) and simulates different patient sizes. Determining which image slices are suitable for analysis currently requires manual annotation of these patterns by an expert, as subtle defects may make an image unsuitable for measurement. We propose a method of automatically classifying these test patterns in a series of phantom images using deep learning techniques. By adapting a convolutional neural network based on the VGG19 architecture with weights trained on ImageNet, we use transfer learning to produce a classifier for this domain. The classifier is trained and evaluated with over 3,500 phantom images acquired at a university medical center. Input channels for color images are successfully adapted to convey contextual information for phantom images. A series of ablation studies are employed to verify design aspects of the classifier and evaluate its performance under varying training conditions.

Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. Small animal imaging is essential in building a bridge from basic science to the clinic by providing the confidence necessary to move new cancer therapies to patients. However, there is considerable variability in preclinical imaging, including tumor volume estimations based on tumor segmentation procedures which can be clearly user-biased. Our group is engaged in developing quantitative imaging methods which will be applied in the preclinical arm of a co-clinical trial studying synergy between anti-PD-1 treatment and radiotherapy using a genetically engineered mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma. This study focuses on a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for automatic tumor segmentation based on multimodal MRI images, i.e. T1 weighted, T2 weighted and T1 weighted with contrast agent. Our images were acquired on a 7.0 T Bruker Biospec small animal MRI scanner. Preliminary results show that our U-net structure and 3D patch-wise approach using both Dice and cross entropy loss functions delivers strong segmentation results. We have also compared single performance using only T2 weighted versus multimodal MR images for CNN segmentation. Our results showthat Dice similarity coefficient were higher when using multimodal versus single T2 weighted data (0.84 ± 0.05 and 0.81 ± 0.03). In conclusion, we successfully established a segmentation method for preclinical MR sarcoma data based on deep learning.

Performance of the ANNs and the original radiologist's impression were evaluated with five metrics: receiver operating characteristic area index (Az); specificity at given sensitivities of 100%, 98%, and 95%; and positive predictive value. RESULTS: All three ANNs consistently outperformed the radiologist's impression over all five performance metrics. The patient-age variable was particularly valuable. Adding the age variable to the basic ANN model, which used only the BI-RADS findings, significantly improved Az (P = .028). In fact, replacing all history data with just the age variable resulted in virtually no changes for Az or specificity at 98% sensitivity (P = .324 and P = .410, respectively).

Machine learning-driven, physics-based simulations provide a means to understand how potentially correlated conditions may affect a particular patient. Here, we use a combination of machine learning and massively parallel computing to predict the effects of physiological factors on hemodynamics in patients with coarctation of the aorta. We first validated blood flow simulations against in vitro measurements in 3D-printed phantoms representing the patient's vasculature. We then investigated the effects of varying the degree of stenosis, blood flow rate, and viscosity on two diagnostic metrics - pressure gradient across the stenosis (ΔP) and wall shear stress (WSS) - by performing the largest simulation study to date of coarctation of the aorta (over 70 million compute hours). Using machine learning models trained on data from the simulations and validated on two independent datasets, we developed a framework to identify the minimal training set required to build a predictive model on a per-patient basis.

Particular challenges, similarly as in other segmentation problems, include the class-imbalance problem as well as confounding background in DCE-MR images. To address these issues, we propose a mask-guided hierarchical learning (MHL) framework for breast tumor segmentation via fully convolutional networks (FCN). Specifically, we first develop an FCN model to generate a 3D breast mask as the region of interest (ROI) for each image, to remove confounding information from input DCE-MR images. We then design a two-stage FCN model to perform coarse-to-fine segmentation for breast tumors. Particularly, we propose a Dice-Sensitivity-like loss function and a reinforcement sampling strategy to handle the class-imbalance problem. To precisely identify locations of tumors that underwent a biopsy, we further propose an FCN model to detect two landmarks located at two nipples. We finally selected the biopsied tumor based on both identified landmarks and segmentations. We validate our MHL method on 272 patients, achieving a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.72 which is comparable to mutual DSC between expert radiologists. Using the segmented biopsied tumors, we also demonstrate that the automatically generated masks can be applied to radiogenomics and can identify luminal A subtype from other molecular subtypes with the similar accuracy with the analysis based on semi-manual tumor segmentation.", "publication_location": "Ieee Trans Med Imaging", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2018.2865671", "citations": "14", "readership": "55", "tweets": "11", "news_mentions": " "},

Computer simulations demonstrate that, under these assumptions, the model correctly describes: (1) the impairment of LI by amphetamine when a strong unconditioned stimulus (US) is used, (2) the impairment of LI by amphetamine when a nonsalient CS is used, (3) the impairment of LI by amphetamine administration when a short CS is used, (4) the facilitation of LI by alpha-flupenthixol when a weak US is used, (5) the facilitation of LI by haloperidol when a nonsalient CS is used, (6) the facilitation of LI by haloperidol with a strong US, and (7) the facilitation of LI by haloperidol with extended conditioning.", "publication_location": "Behavioural Pharmacology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00008877-199812000-00007", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The goal-seeking mechanism displays exploratory behavior until either the goal is found or a sufficiently strong prediction of the goal is generated. The cognitive map is a topological map that stores associations between places and views of accessible places, and between places and reward. The route system establishes associations between cues and reward. Both systems compete with each other to establish associations with the reward, with the cognitive system generally overshadowing the route system. In agreement with previous models, it is assumed that the hippocampus modulates the storage of cognitive maps in cortical areas and mediates the competition between cognitive maps and route systems. After hippocampal lesions, animals navigate through mazes making use of the route system.

Advanced machine-learning (ML) techniques offer an unprecedented opportunity to increase the accuracy of board-level functional diagnosis and reduce high-volume manufacturing cost through successful repair.

One thread of research in the buried threat detection literature is to use visual descriptors from the computer vision literature. One recent, very successful approach in that field is the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Applying CNNs requires a large number of design choices which complicate their use. In this work, we investigate their application to GPR data and adapt several recent advances from the CNN literature to improve detection performance on GPR data.

The Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a remote sensing modality that has been used to collect data for the task of buried threat detection. The returns of the GPR can be organized as images in which the characteristic visual patterns of threats can be leveraged for detection using visual descriptors. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to this problem, inspired by their state-of-the-art-performance on object recognition tasks in natural images. One well known limitation of CNNs is that they require large amounts of data for training (i.e., parameter inference) to avoid overfitting (i.e., poor generalization). This presents a major challenge for target detection in GPR because of the (relatively) few labeled examples of targets and non-target GPR data. In this work we use a popular transfer learning approach for CNNs to address this problem. In this approach we train two CNN on other, much larger, datasets of grayscale imagery for different problems. Specifically, we pre-train our CNNs on (i) the popular Cifar10 dataset, and (ii) a dataset of high resolution aerial imagery for detecting solar photovoltaic arrays. We then use varying subsets of the parameters from these two pre-trained CNNs to initialize the training of our buried threat detection networks for GPR data.

Deep neural network (DNN) models are being expanded to a broader range of applications. The computational capability of traditional hardware platforms cannot accommodate the growth of model complexity. Among recent technologies to accelerate DNN, resistive memory (ReRAM)-based processing-in-memory (PIM) emerged as a promising solution for DNN inference due to its high efficiency for matrix-based computation. We face two major technical challenges in extending the use of ReRAM-based accelerators for training: (1) full-precision data is essential in back-propagation; (2) the need to support both feed-forward and back-propagation aggravates the data-movement burden. We propose a heterogeneous architecture named as 3D-ReG, which leverages full-precision GPU to ensure training accuracy and low-overhead 3D integration to provide low-cost data movements. Moreover, we introduce conservative and aggressive task-mapping schemes, which partition the computation phases in different ways to balance execution efficiency and training accuracy. We evaluate 3D-ReG implemented with two 3D integration technologies, through-silicon vias (TSVs) and monolithic inter-tier vias (MIVs), and compare them with GPU-only and PIM-only counterparts. Various GPU-only platforms using two main-memory technologies (DRAM, ReRAM) and three interconnect technologies (2D, TSV, MIV) are evaluated as well. Experimental results show that 3D-ReG can achieve on average 5.64× training speedup and 3.56× higher energy efficiency compared with the GPU with DRAM as main memory, at the cost of 0.05%-3.39% accuracy drop. We define a new metric, gain-loss ratio (GLR), which quantitatively evaluates the capability of a DNN training hardware in terms of the model accuracy and hardware efficiency.

Spectral CT using a photon-counting x-ray detector (PCXD) can potentially increase accuracy of measuring tissue composition. However, PCXD spectral measurements suffer from distortion due to charge sharing, pulse pileup, and Kescape energy loss. This study proposes two novel artificial neural network (ANN)-based algorithms: one to model and compensate for the distortion, and another one to directly correct for the distortion. The ANN-based distortion model was obtained by training to learn the distortion from a set of projections with a calibration scan. The ANN distortion was then applied in the forward statistical model to compensate for distortion in the projection decomposition. ANN was also used to learn to correct distortions directly in projections. The resulting corrected projections were used for reconstructing the image, denoising via joint bilateral filtration, and decomposition into three-material basis functions: Compton scattering, the photoelectric effect, and iodine. The ANN-based distortion model proved to be more robust to noise and worked better compared to using an imperfect parametric distortion model. In the presence of noise, the mean relative errors in iodine concentration estimation were 11.82% (ANN distortion model) and 16.72% (parametric model). With distortion correction, the mean relative error in iodine concentration estimation was improved by 50% over direct decomposition from distorted data. With our joint bilateral filtration, the resulting material image quality and iodine detectability as defined by the contrast-to-noise ratio were greatly enhanced allowing iodine concentrations as low as 2 mg/ml to be detected.

MJ-CNN contains three models at multi-scale levels for a coarse-to-fine DIR to avoid being trapped in a local minimum. It is trained based on image similarity and deformation vector field (DVF) smoothness, requiring no supervision of ground-truth DVF. The three models are first trained sequentially and separately for their own registration tasks, and then are trained jointly for an end-to-end optimization under the multi-scale framework. In this study, MJ-CNN was trained using public SPARE 4D-CT data. The trained MJ-CNN was then evaluated on public DIR-LAB 4D-CT dataset as well as clinical CT-to-CBCT and CBCT-to-CBCT registration. For 4D-CT inter-phase registration, MJ-CNN achieved comparable accuracy to conventional iteration optimization-based methods, and showed the smallest registration errors compared to recently published deep learning-based DIR methods, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed multi-scale joint training scheme. Besides, MJ-CNN trained using one dataset (SPARE) could generalize to a different dataset (DIR-LAB) acquired by different scanners and imaging protocols. Furthermore, MJ-CNN trained on 4D-CTs also performed well on CT-to-CBCT and CBCT-to-CBCT registration without any re-training or fine-tuning, demonstrating MJ-CNN's robustness against applications and imaging techniques.

To explore the utility of these emerging technologies in a challenging field setting, we used neural networks to enumerate olive ridley turtles Lepidochelys olivacea in drone images acquired during a mass-nesting event on the coast of Ostional, Costa Rica. Results revealed substantial promise for this approach; specifically, our model detected 8% more turtles than manual counts while effectively reducing the manual validation burden from 2,971,554 to 44,822 image windows. Our detection pipeline was trained on a relatively small set of turtle examples (N = 944), implying that this method can be easily bootstrapped for other applications, and is practical with real-world UAS datasets. Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining UAS and neural networks to estimate population levels of diverse marine animals and suggest that the automation inherent in these techniques will soon permit monitoring over spatial and temporal scales that would previously have been impractical.", "publication_location": "Methods in Ecology and Evolution", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13132", "citations": "22", "readership": "83", "tweets": "91", "news_mentions": " "},

The many-body expansion method is a common strategy to partition the total Hamiltonian of large systems into a hierarchy of few-body terms. Neural networks were trained to represent electrostatically embedded one-body and two-body interactions, which require as input only one and two water molecule calculations at the level of ab initio electronic structure method CCSD/aug-cc-pVDZ embedded in the molecular mechanics water environment, making it efficient as a general force field construction approach.

We constructed two sets of neural network based force fields: nonpolarizable and polarizable force fields.

If the whole nerve innervates multiple target organs or muscles then the recorded activity will be the superposition of the activity of different nerve fibers innervating these organs. In certain cases it is desirable to monitor mixed nerve activity and to determine the origin (modality) of the recorded activity. A method using the autocorrelation function of recorded nerve activity and an artificial neural network was developed to classify the modality of nerve signals. The method works in cases where different end organs are innervated by nerve fibers having different diameter distributions. The electrical activity in the cat S1 sacral spinal root was recorded using a cuff electrode during the activation of cutaneous, bladder, and rectal mechanoreceptors. Using the classification method, 87.5% of nerve signals were correctly classified.

The spatially invariant network would take a portion of the image as its input and estimate the scatter content as output. The trained network was applied to the other five images, and errors were evaluated between estimated and measured scatter values. Performance was compared against a convolution scatter estimation algorithm. The network was evaluated as a function of network size, initial values, and duration of training. Network performance was evaluated qualitatively by the correlation of network weights to physical models, and quantitatively by training and evaluation errors. Using DPCXRs as input, the network learned to describe known scatter exposures accurately (7% error) and estimate scatter in new images (< 8% error) slightly better than convolution methods. Regardless of size and initial shape, all networks adapted into radial exponentials with magnitude of 0.75, perhaps implying an ideal point spread function and average scatter fraction, respectively.

The geometry of the patients, with cancer of the prostate, was modelled by reducing the external contour, planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs) to a set of cuboids. The coordinates and size of the cuboids were given to the ANN as inputs. A previously developed beam-orientation constrained-customization (BOCC) scheme employing a conventional computer algorithm was used to determine the customized beam orientations in a training set containing 45 patient datasets. Twelve patient datasets not involved in the training of the artificial neural network were used to test whether the ANN was able to map the inputs to customized beam orientations. Improvements from the customized beam orientations were compared with standard treatment plans with fixed gantry angles and plans produced from the BOCC scheme. The ANN produced customized beam orientations within 5 degrees of the BOCC scheme in 62.5% of cases. The average difference in the beam orientations produced by the ANN and the BOCC scheme was 7.7 degrees (+/-1.7, 1 SD). Compared with the standard treatment plans, the BOCC scheme produced plans with an increase in the average tumour control probability (TCP) of 5.7% (+/-1.4, 1 SD) whilst the ANN generated plans increased the average TCP by 3.9% (+/-1.3, 1 SD).

The system is composed of (a) an action system, consisting of a goal-seeking neural mechanism controlled by a motivational system; and (b) a cognitive system, involving a neural cognitive map. The goal-seeking mechanism displays exploratory behavior until either (a) the goal is found or (b) an adequate prediction of the goal is generated. The cognitive map built by the network is a topological map, i.e., it represents only the adjacency, but not distances or directions, between places. The network has recurrent and non-recurrent properties that allow the reading of the cognitive map without modifying it. Two types of predictions are introduced: fast-time and real-time predictions. Fast-time predictions are produced in advance of what occurs in real time, when the information stored in the cognitive map is used to predict the remote future. Real-time predictions are generated simultaneously with the occurrence of environmental events, when the information stored in the cognitive map is being updated. Computer simulations show that the network successfully describes latent learning and detour behavior in rats. In addition, simulations demonstrate that the network can be applied to problem-solving paradigms such as the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.", "publication_location": "Biological Cybernetics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00201023", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The database consisted of 235 patients with lung cancer treated using radiotherapy, of whom 34 were diagnosed with Grade 2+ pneumonitis at follow-up. The network was constructed using an algorithm that alternately grew and pruned it, starting from the smallest possible network, until a satisfactory solution was found. The weights and biases of the network were computed using the error back-propagation approach. Momentum and variable leaning techniques were used to speed convergence. Using the growing/pruning approach, the network selected features from 66 dose and 27 non-dose variables. During network training, the 235 patients were randomly split into ten groups of approximately equal size. Eight groups were used to train the network, one group was used for early stopping training to prevent overfitting, and the remaining group was used as a test to measure the generalization capability of the network (cross-validation). Using this methodology, each of the ten groups was considered, in turn, as the test group (ten-fold cross-validation). For the optimized network constructed with input features selected from dose and non-dose variables, the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for cross-validated testing was 0.76 (sensitivity: 0.68, specificity: 0.69). For the optimized network constructed with input features selected only from dose variables, the area under the ROC curve for cross-validation was 0.67 (sensitivity: 0.53, specificity: 0.69). The difference between these two areas was statistically significant (p = 0.020), indicating that the addition of non-dose features can significantly improve the generalization capability of the network. A network for prospective testing was constructed with input features selected from dose and non-dose variables (all data were used for training). The optimized network architecture consisted of six input nodes (features), four hidden nodes, and one output node. The six input features were: lung volume receiving > 16 Gy (V16), generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) for the exponent a = 1 (mean lung dose), gEUD for the exponent a = 3.5, free expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO%), and whether or not the patient underwent chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy. The significance of each input feature was individually evaluated by omitting it during network training and gauging its impact by the consequent deterioration in cross-validated ROC area.

The statistics of the input stream may be stationary, or changing. Each stimulus induces, in a stochastic way, transitions between stable synaptic states. Learning dynamics is studied analytically in the slow learning limit, in which a given stimulus has to be presented many times before it is memorized, i.e. before synaptic modifications enable a pattern of activity correlated with the stimulus to become an attractor of the recurrent network. We show that in this limit the synaptic matrix becomes more correlated with the class prototypes than with any of the instances of the class.

In the last few years with the advent of new imaging technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) it has become possible to explore the integrated central nervous system (both biochemically and biophysically) in living humans. A major limitation in utilizing these techniques in an optimal fashion has been the lack of sophisticated image analysis systems which can extract the relevant information from the images in an automated or semiautomated manner. Brain MR images contain massive information requiring lengthy and complex interpretation (as in the identification of significant portions of the image), quantitative evaluation (as in the determination of the size of certain significant regions), and sophisticated interpretation (as in determining any image portions which indicate signs of lesions or of disease). In this paper we first survey the clinical and research needs for brain imaging. We present the state-of-the-art in relevant image analysis techniques. We then discuss our recent work on the use of novel artificial neural networks which have a recurrent structure to extract precise morphometric information from MRI scans of the human brain. Finally, experimental data using our novel approach is presented and suggestions are made for future research. © 1996 IEEE.", "publication_location": "Proceedings of the Ieee", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/5.537113", "citations": "58", "readership": "27", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The ADMLP-NN was composed of several artificial neural networks (ANNs) which were used as weaker predictors to compose a stronger predictor. The respiratory signal was initially smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay finite impulse response smoothing filter (S-G filter). Then, several similar multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLP-NNs) were configured to estimate future respiratory signal position from its previous positions. Finally, an adaptive boosting (Adaboost) decision algorithm was used to set weights for each MLP-NN based on the sample prediction error of each MLP-NN. Two prediction methods, MLP-NN and ADMLP-NN (MLP-NN plus adaptive boosting), were evaluated by calculating correlation coefficient and root-mean-square-error between true and predicted signals. For predicting 500 ms ahead of prediction, average correlation coefficients were improved from 0.83 (MLP-NN method) to 0.89 (ADMLP-NN method). The average of root-mean-square-error (relative unit) for 500 ms ahead of prediction using ADMLP-NN were reduced by 27.9%, compared to those using MLP-NN.

Using laboratory data, we assess the potential of artificial neural networks to investigate the relations between geotechnical and electrical parameters characterizing a variety of soils. The geotechnical parameters are: fines content, mean grain size, mean pore size and the specific surface area. The electrical parameters obtained from low-frequency electrical measurements (4 Hz) include the resistivity amplitude, phase shift and the loss tangent. Relations that can be used to predict the geotechnical parameters of a soil given its electrical parameters are developed. The predictive capabilities of the neural networks are compared with traditional multivariate regression models. The performances of the neural network and regression models in predicting (a) the geotechnical parameter given the same electrical parameters as inputs and (b) the electrical parameters given the same geotechnical parameters as inputs are compared. In both cases, the neural network outperforms the multivariate regression as the neural network is able to capture and model the non-linear and complex relationships among the variables. The relative importance of the geotechnical parameters on the overall electrical conduction was examined using the neural networks. The results indicate that mean grain size and fines content are the two geotechnical parameters that influence phase-shift values the most; fines content and mean pore size influence the resistivity amplitude the most, whilst fines content and mean grain size influence the loss tangent the most.

The ability to enrich cell harvests for specific phenotypes can have significant effects on the overall success of such therapies. While most techniques for cell sorting or enrichment have relied on cell surface markers, recent studies have shown that single-cell mechanical properties can serve as identifying markers of phenotype. In this study, a neural network modeling approach was developed to classify mesenchymal-derived primary and stem cells based on their biomechanical properties. Cell sorting was simulated using previously published data characterizing the mechanical properties of several different cell types as measured by atomic force microscopy. Neural networks were trained using combined data sets, with the resultant groupings analyzed for their purity, efficiency, and enrichment. Heterogeneous populations of zonal chondrocytes, chondrosarcoma cells, and mesenchymal-lineage cells, respectively, could all be classified into enriched subpopulations. Additionally, adult stem cells (adipose-derived or bone marrow-derived) separated disproportionately into nodes associated with the three primary mesenchymal lineages examined. These findings suggest that mathematical approaches such as neural network modeling, in combination with novel measures of cell properties, may provide a means of classifying and eventually sorting mixed populations of cells that are otherwise difficult to identify using more established techniques. In this respect, the identification of biomechanically based cell properties that increase the percentage of stem cells capable of differentiating into predictable lineages may improve the overall success of cell-based therapies.", "publication_location": "Tissue Engineering.

Space variability refers to the observations of Z along the vertical atmospheric profile, at 11 constant altitude plan position indicator levels, namely ZT = (Z1, ⋯, Z11). Time variability refers to the observations of Z at the time intervals prior to that for which the estimate of R is provided. Space variability is evaluated by performing a principal component analysis over standardized values of Z, namely Z̃, and the first two principal components of Z̃ (which describe 91% of the original variance) are used to synthesize the elements of Z into fewer orthogonal inputs for the networks. Network predictions significantly improve when the models are trained with the two principal components of Z with respect to the case in which only Z1 is used.

In the context of the present neural network model, the contradictory pattern of results is the effect of the interactions between the information encoding mechanisms (cognitive mapping) and the attentional feedback mechanisms (tracking the total novelty in the environment) under the assumption that hippocampal lesions hinder information encoding. We demonstrate through computer simulations that, under conditions corresponding to specific experimental procedures, the model counterintuitively predicts a facilitation of LI after hippocampal lesions. A parametric study suggests that the main factors in the above interaction are (a) the preexposure time, and (b) the experimental procedure.

One phase of a prior 4D-MRI is set as the prior phase, MRIprior. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to extract three major respiratory deformation modes from the DFMs generated between the prior and remaining phases. VC-MRI at each time-step is considered a deformation of MRIprior, where the DFM is represented as a weighted linear combination of the PCA components. The PCA weightings are solved by minimizing the differences between on-board 2D cine MRI and its corresponding VC-MRI slice. The PCA weightings solved during the initial training period are used to train an ADMLP-NN to predict PCA weightings ahead of time during the prediction period. The predicted PCA weightings are used to build predicted 3D DFM and ultimately, predicted VC-MRIs for 4D target tracking. The method was evaluated using a 4D computerized phantom (XCAT) with patient breathing curves and MRI data from a real liver cancer patient. Effects of breathing amplitude change and ADMLP-NN parameter variations were assessed. The accuracy of the PCA curve prediction was evaluated. The predicted real-time 3D tumor was evaluated against the ground-truth using volume dice coefficient (VDC), center-of-mass-shift (COMS), and target tracking errors.

The internal model of the environment provides predictions of the aversive stimulus based on environmental stimuli and the animal's own responses, and these predictions are used to train the operant conditioning block to generate responses that minimize the aversive stimulus. Computer simulations show that the model correctly describes many of the features that characterize escape and avoidance. The network also is able to describe the imitation of a demonstrator by an observer. During the demonstration, a neural network representing the observer stores classical associations between environmental stimuli and the demonstrator's responses and aversive stimuli, and these associations serve to train the operant associations during the observer's performance. It is assumed that the demonstrator's responses evoke a representation of identical responses in the observer and that the demonstrator's unconditioned response to the aversive stimulus serves as an aversive reinforcer for the observer.

As an alternative to these seemingly conflicting views, we hypothesized that the hippocampus computes 'aggregate predictions' of environmental events that are used to control associative learning. Aggregate predictions forecast what event is going to occur, when in time, and where in space. The hypothesis assumes that activity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons is proportional to the instantaneous value of the aggregate prediction, and that the computation of the aggregate prediction is impaired by hippocampal lesions. In order to test the 'aggregate prediction' hypothesis in both spatial and temporal tasks, this paper presents a real-time neural network capable of describing temporal discrimination and spatial learning in a unified fashion. The neural network incorporates detectors that can be tuned to a particular value of continuous temporal or spatial variables. In the temporal domain, computer simulations were carried out for temporal discrimination in classical conditioning and instrumental learning, classical conditioning under different interstimulus intervals (ISIs), and classical conditioning with mixed ISIs. In the spatial domain, computer simulations were carried out for place and cue learning. The paper shows that under the 'aggregate prediction' hypothesis the network correctly describes activity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and the effect of hippocampal lesions in temporal and spatial learning.

RRAM crossbar consisting of memristor devices can naturally carry out the matrix-vector multiplication; it thereby has gained a great momentum as a highly energy-efficient accelerator for neuromorphic computing.

Existing hardware-based solutions cause enormous overhead and power consumption, while software-based solutions are less efficient in tolerating stuck-at faults and large variations. In this paper, we propose an accelerator-friendly neural-network training method, by leveraging the inherent self-healing capability of the neural-network, to prevent the large-weight synapses from being mapped to the abnormal memristors based on the fault/variation distribution in the RRAM crossbar.

Sensory representations compete among themselves for a limited-capacity short-term memory (STM) that is reflected in a long-term memory storage. The STM regulation hypothesis, which proposes that the hippocampus controls incentive motivation, self-excitation, and competition among sensory representations thereby regulating the contents of a limited capacity STM, is introduced. Under the STM regulation hypothesis, nodes and connections in Grossberg's neural network are mapped onto regional hippocampal-cerebellar circuits.

Yet the presence of BALs is also a complication for large spectroscopic surveys that use quasars as cosmological probes because the BAL features can affect redshift measurements and contaminate information about the matter distribution in the Lyα forest. We present a new BAL QSO catalog for quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 14 (DR14). As the SDSS DR14 quasar catalog has over 500,000 quasars, we have developed an automated BAL classifier with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We trained our CNN classifier on the C iv λ 1549 region of a sample of quasars with reliable human classifications, and compared the results to both a dedicated test sample and visual classifications from the earlier SDSS DR12 quasar catalog. Our CNN classifier correctly classifies over 98% of the BAL quasars in the DR12 catalog, which demonstrates comparable reliability to human classification. The disagreements are generally for quasars with lower signal-to-noise ratio spectra and/or weaker BAL features. Our new catalog includes the probability that each quasar is a BAL, the strength, blueshifts and velocity widths of the troughs, and similar information for any Si iv λ 1398 BAL troughs that may be present.

Synaptic dynamics is an unsupervised, analogue Hebbian process, but long term memory in the absence of neural activity is maintained by a refresh mechanism which on long timescales discretizes the synaptic values, converting learning into asynchronous stochastic process induced by the stimuli on the synaptic efficacies. This network is intended to lean a set of amactors from the statistics of freely arriving stimuli, which are represented by extemal synaptic inputs injected into the excitatory neurons. In the simulations different types of sequences of many thousands of stimuli are presented to Ihe network, without distinguishing in the dynamics a leaming phase from retrieval. Stimulus sequences differ in pre-assigned global statistics (including time-dependent statistics); in orders of presentation of individual stimuli within a given statistics: in lengths of time intervals for each presentation and in the intervals separating one stimulus from another. We find that the network effectively learns a set of attractors representing the statistics of the stimuli. and is able to modify its amactors when the input staristics change. Moreover, as the global input statistics changes the network can also forget attracton related to stimulus classes no longer presented. Forgetting takes place only due to the arrival of new stimuli. The performance of the network and the statistics of he amactors are studied as a function of the inmt statistics.

METHODS: One hundred eyes were classified using optic disc examination and perimetry into normal (n=35), POAG suspects (n=30), and POAG (n=35). EasyNN-plus simulator was used to develop an ANN model with inputs including age, sex, myopia, intraocular pressure (IOP), optic nerve head, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) parameters on OCT, Octopus 30-2 full threshold visual field, and GDx parameters. RESULTS: With two outputs (POAG or normal), specificity was 80% and sensitivity was 93.3%. Ninety percent of POAG suspects were labeled as abnormal in this analysis. ANN assigned the highest importance to Smax/Imax RNFL on OCT followed by cup-area (OCT) and other RNFL parameters (OCT) for two outputs. With three outputs (normal, POAG, and POAG suspect), ANN gave an overall classification rate of 65%, specificity of 60%, and sensitivity of 71.4% with a target error rate of the training set at 1%. The parameters for three outputs, in decreasing order of relative importance, were Savg, vertical cup-disc ratio, cup-volume, and cup-area on OCT.

By following the big data revolution, neuromorphic computing makes a comeback for its great potential in information processing capability. Despite of many types of architectures reported in conventional CMOS domain, memristor, as an example of emerging devices, demonstrates an intrinsic support of parallel matrix-vector multiplication operation that is widely used in artificial neural network applications. However, its computation accuracy and speed are far from satisfactory, mainly constrained by the features of memristor crossbar array and peripheral circuitry. In this work, we propose a new memristor crossbar based computing engine design by leveraging a current sensing scheme. High parallelism in operation and therefore fast computation can be achieved via simultaneously supplying analog voltages into a memristor crossbar and directly converting the weighted current through a current-to-voltage converter.

We exploit this relationship by classifying a human participant's wake/sleep status using his instantaneous heart rate (IHR) series. APPROACH:We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to build features from the IHR series extracted from a whole-night electrocardiogram (ECG) and predict every 30 s whether the participant is awake or asleep. Our training database consists of 56 normal participants, and we consider three different databases for validation; one is private, and two are public with different races and apnea severities. MAIN RESULTS:On our private database of 27 participants, our accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and [Formula: see text] values for predicting the wake stage are [Formula: see text], 52.4%, 89.4%, and 0.83, respectively. Validation performance is similar on our two public databases. When we use the photoplethysmography instead of the ECG to obtain the IHR series, the performance is also comparable. A robustness check is carried out to confirm the obtained performance statistics.

{"title": "A neural network-based method for spectral distortion correction in photon counting x-ray CT.", "authors": "Touch, M; Clark, DP; Barber, W; Badea, CT", "published_date": "August 21, 2016", "doi": "10.1088/0031-9155/61/16/6132", "abstract": "Spectral CT using a photon counting x-ray detector (PCXD) shows great potential for measuring material composition based on energy dependent x-ray attenuation. Spectral CT is especially suited for imaging with K-edge contrast agents to address the otherwise limited contrast in soft tissues. We have developed a micro-CT system based on a PCXD. This system enables both 4 energy bins acquisition, as well as full-spectrum mode in which the energy thresholds of the PCXD are swept to sample the full energy spectrum for each detector element and projection angle. Measurements provided by the PCXD, however, are distorted due to undesirable physical effects in the detector and can be very noisy due to photon starvation in narrow energy bins. To address spectral distortions, we propose and demonstrate a novel artificial neural network (ANN)-based spectral distortion correction mechanism, which learns to undo the distortion in spectral CT, resulting in improved material decomposition accuracy. To address noise, post-reconstruction denoising based on bilateral filtration, which jointly enforces intensity gradient sparsity between spectral samples, is used to further improve the robustness of ANN training and material decomposition accuracy. Our ANN-based distortion correction method is calibrated using 3D-printed phantoms and a model of our spectral CT system. To enable realistic simulations and validation of our method, we first modeled the spectral distortions using experimental data acquired from (109)Cd and (133)Ba radioactive sources measured with our PCXD. Next, we trained an ANN to learn the relationship between the distorted spectral CT projections and the ideal, distortion-free projections in a calibration step. This required knowledge of the ground truth, distortion-free spectral CT projections, which were obtained by simulating a spectral CT scan of the digital version of a 3D-printed phantom. Once the training was completed, the trained ANN was used to perform distortion correction on any subsequent scans of the same system with the same parameters. We used joint bilateral filtration to perform noise reduction by jointly enforcing intensity gradient sparsity between the reconstructed images for each energy bin. Following reconstruction and denoising, the CT data was spectrally decomposed using the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and a K-edge material (i.e. iodine). The ANN-based distortion correction approach was tested using both simulations and experimental data acquired in phantoms and a mouse with our PCXD-based micro-CT system for 4 bins and full-spectrum acquisition modes. The iodine detectability and decomposition accuracy were assessed using the contrast-to-noise ratio and relative error in iodine concentration estimation metrics in images with and without distortion correction. In simulation, the material decomposition accuracy in the reconstructed data was vastly improved following distortion correction and denoising, with 50% and 20% reductions in material concentration measurement error in full-spectrum and 4 energy bins cases, respectively. Overall, experimental data confirms that full-spectrum mode provides superior results to 4-energy mode when the distortion corrections are applied. The material decomposition accuracy in the reconstructed data was vastly improved following distortion correction and denoising, with as much as a 41% reduction in material concentration measurement error for full-spectrum mode, while also bringing the iodine detectability to 4-6 mg ml(-1). Distortion correction also improved the 4 bins mode data, but to a lesser extent. The results demonstrate the experimental feasibility and potential advantages of ANN-based distortion correction and joint bilateral filtration-based denoising for accurate K-edge imaging with a PCXD. Given the computational efficiency with which the ANN can be applied to projection data, the proposed scheme can be readily integrated into existing CT reconstruction pipelines.", "publication_location": "Phys Med Biol", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/61/16/6132", "citations": "16", "readership": "52", "tweets": "2", "news_mentions": " "},

Therefore, this paper presents an indirect training algorithm that, instead, is designed to manipulate input spike trains (stimuli) that can be implemented by patterns of blue light, or controlled input voltages, to induce the desired synaptic weights changes via STDP.

All rights reserved. Deep neural networks are widely used for classification. These deep models often suffer from a lack of interpretability - they are particularly difficult to understand because of their non-linear nature. As a result, neural networks are often treated as “black box” models, and in the past, have been trained purely to optimize the accuracy of predictions. In this work, we create a novel network architecture for deep learning that naturally explains its own reasoning for each prediction. This architecture contains an autoencoder and a special prototype layer, where each unit of that layer stores a weight vector that resembles an encoded training input. The encoder of the autoencoder allows us to do comparisons within the latent space, while the decoder allows us to visualize the learned prototypes. The training objective has four terms: an accuracy term, a term that encourages every prototype to be similar to at least one encoded input, a term that encourages every encoded input to be close to at least one prototype, and a term that encourages faithful reconstruction by the autoencoder. The distances computed in the prototype layer are used as part of the classification process. Since the prototypes are learned during training, the learned network naturally comes with explanations for each prediction, and the explanations are loyal to what the network actually computes.", "publication_location": "32nd Aaai Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Aaai 2018", "link": null, "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

When pursuing these goals, animals and humans display a remarkable adaptability, which is the result of the combination of a goal-seeking mechanism and a cognitive map. Whereas the goal-seeking mechanism permits the animal to seek different goals, adopting alternative behavioral strategies that are independent of any set of responses, the cognitive map allows the integration of multiple independent pieces of knowledge. Although the concept of cognitive mapping has been mostly applied to spatial mapping, we describe how both spatial and temporal cognitive maps can be mechanistically implemented in terms of recurrent associative networks which store either the adjacency of spatial locations or the contiguity of temporal events. The reinjected predictions of spatial locations or temporal events in the network can be conceptualized as images and their sequences conceptualized as the process of imagining. The combination of goal-seeking systems and cognitive maps permits the description of problem solving tasks in terms of the sequence of subgoals (a plan) to be pursued to reach the goal.

The immediate early gene c-fos that encodes the Fos protein can be induced rapidly and transiently in neurons by increased electrical activity. Animals were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose, and received one of four stimulus protocols: electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerve, electrical stimulation of the pudendal nerve, a period of isometric micturition (induced by ligating the proximal urethra and infusing saline into the bladder), or electrical stimulation of Barrington's nucleus. After the period of stimulation, the animals were perfused and neurons expressing Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) were visualized with immunocytochemical methods. Stimulation with each protocol resulted in a substantially larger number of neurons expressing FLI than in operated but unstimulated controls, which exhibited few Fos-positive neurons localized to the superficial dorsal horn. In animals undergoing isometric micturition or stimulation of Barrington's nucleus, neurons exhibiting FLI were found bilaterally in the sacral (S1-S3) spinal cord and were localized to the lateral portion of the superficial dorsal horn (laminae I and II), in the intermediolateral region (lateral laminae V-VII), and around the central canal (lamina X and medial laminae V-VII). The intermediolateral region appeared to contain two populations of cells exhibiting FLI: a group of large multipolar cells and a group of small round cells. Few Fos-immunoreactive nuclei were observed in the medial portion of the superficial dorsal horn, and FLI was not observed in ventral horn neurons. Electrical stimulation of the pudendal or pelvic nerves resulted in fewer numbers of cells exhibiting FLI, with a less widespread spatial distribution. These results identify spinal neurons that are active during the micturition cycle, and demonstrate that a behaviorally relevant stimulus (isometric micturition) generated more widespread and greater intensity of Fos expression than repetitive electrical stimulation of the component peripheral nerves.", "publication_location": "Brain Research", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0006-8993(98)00340-0", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

In this work, we explore different training algorithms of SNN for real-world applications, and demonstrate that the Neural Sampling method is much more effective than Spiking Time Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Remote Supervision Method (ReSuMe). We also propose an energy efficient implementation of SNN with the emerging metal-oxide resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices, which includes an RRAM crossbar array works as network synapses, an analog design of the spike neuron, and an input encoding scheme. A parameter mapping algorithm is also introduced to configure the RRAM-based SNN. Simulation results illustrate that the system achieves 91.2% accuracy on the MNIST dataset with an ultra-low power consumption of 3.5mW. Moreover, the RRAM-based SNN system demonstrates great robustness to 20% process variation with less than 1% accuracy decrease, and can tolerate 20% signal fluctuation with about 2% accuracy loss. These results reveal that the RRAM-based SNN will be quite easy to be physically realized.", "publication_location": "Proceedings  Design, Automation and Test in Europe, Date", "link": null, "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Driver models have been previously developed using control theoretic approaches, such as model predictive control, also known as receding horizon control, and have been shown capable of providing satisfactory vehicle control. However, these models tend to outperform human drivers, for example, due to maneuvers that require highfrequency driver compensation, counter-steering behaviors as required to maintain stability, or modeling errors. Furthermore, tuning these driver models to different drivers, automobiles, and road conditions, can be very challenging, and requires expert human intervention. This paper presents an artificial neural network controller that overcomes these limitations, and, by adapting to the experimental data obtained from the human driver, is capable of reproducing the driver behavior more closely and under a broader range of operating conditions. The receding horizon and neural network controllers are tested and compared to the response of a professional human driver on a closed-course track using data obtained using a highfidelity Ferrari GT driving simulator. The results show that the artificial neural network outperforms the receding horizon controller in mimicking the response of the professional human driver. © 2013 IEEE.", "publication_location": "Proceedings of the Ieee Conference on Decision and Control", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2013.6760963", "citations": "11", "readership": "25", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Compared with the algorithm optimizations, brain-inspired neural network chips aim to fundamentally change the computer architecture and therefore enhance the computation capability and performance in advanced data processing. In recent years, memristor technology has been investigated in developing high-speed and large-capacity neural network chips. However, it has been observed that memristance values that represent the well-trained network weights can be disturbed by electrical or thermal perturbations. It severely degrades overall system reliability and emerges as a major design challenge. In this work, we systematically analyze the impacts of low-voltage induced memristance drift upon weight disturbance after times of recall operations. A closed-loop design by introducing a real-time feedback controller is proposed to enhance the weight stability of memristor based neural network chips. By mimicking the training process, the controller adaptively compensates the memristance deviation, according to the relation of the input data and recall output. In view of tiny disturbance per access, we integrate the memristance compensation into regular recall operation to avoid the execution speed degradation. Our simulations based on the implementation of representative single-layer (two-layer) network show that the proposed closed-loop design can prolong the service time of memristor-based neural network chip by 14.85x (14.94x), without reducing computational speed.

However the effectiveness of training algorithms to date is far inferior to those of other artificial neural networks. Moreover, they rely on directly manipulating the SNN weights, which may not be feasible in a number of their potential applications. This paper presents a novel indirect training approach to modulate spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in an action SNN that serves as a flight controller without directly manipulating its weights. A critic SNN is directly trained with a reward-based Hebbian approach to send spike trains to the action SNN, which in turn controls the aircraft and learns via STDP.

The goal of this study was to quantitate primary tumor histologic factors and to apply these in a neural network computer analysis to determine if more accurate staging could be achieved. All available primary tumor histological slides from 93 CSI NSGCT patients were analyzed for vascular invasion (VI), lymphatic invasion (LI), tunical invasion (TI) and quantitative determination of percentage of the primary tumor composed of embryonal carcinoma (%EMB), yolk sac carcinoma (%YS), teratoma (%TER) and seminoma (%SEM).

Two investigators were provided identical datasets for neural network analysis; one experienced researcher used custom Kohonen and back propagation programs and one less experienced researcher used a commercially available program. For each experiment, a subset of data was used for training, and subsets were blindly used to test the accuracy of the networks. In the custom back propagation network, 86 of 93 patients were correctly staged for an overall accuracy of 92% (sensitivity 88%, specificity 96%).

Study aim: Oxygen Uptake (VO 2 ) is avaluable metric for the prescription of exercise intensity and the monitoring of training progress. However, VO 2 is difficult to assess in anon-laboratory setting. Recently, an artificial neural network (ANN) was used to predict VO 2 responses during aset walking protocol on the treadmill [9]. The purpose of the present study was to test the ability of an ANN to predict VO 2 responses during cycling at self-selected intensities using Heart Rate (HR), time derivative of HR, power output, cadence, and body mass data. Material and methods: 12 moderately-active adult males (age: 21.1 ± 2.5 years) performed a50-minute bout of cycling at a variety of exercise intensities. VO 2 , HR, power output, and cadence were recorded throughout the test. An ANN was trained, validated and tested using the following inputs: HR, time derivative of HR, power output, cadence, and body mass.

Results: The ANN accurately predicted the experimental VO 2 values throughout the test (R 2 = 0.91 ± 0.04, SEE = 3.34 ± 1.07 mL/kg/min). Discussion: This preliminary study demonstrates the potential for using an ANN to predict VO 2 responses during cycling at varied intensities using easily accessible inputs.

How the brain achieves this perceptual stabilization is unknown, but a major hypothesis is that it relies on presaccadic remapping, a process in which neurons shift their visual sensitivity to a new location in the scene just before each saccade. This hypothesis is difficult to test in vivo because complete, selective inactivation of remapping is currently intractable. We tested it in silico with a hierarchical, sheet-based neural network model of the visual and oculomotor system. The model generated saccadic commands to move a video camera abruptly. Visual input from the camera and internal copies of the saccadic movement commands, or corollary discharge, converged at a map-level simulation of the frontal eye field (FEF), a primate brain area known to receive such inputs. FEF output was combined with eye position signals to yield a suitable coordinate frame for guiding arm movements of a robot. Our operational definition of perceptual stability was \"useful stability,\" quantified as continuously accurate pointing to a visual object despite camera saccades. During training, the emergence of useful stability was correlated tightly with the emergence of presaccadic remapping in the FEF. Remapping depended on corollary discharge but its timing was synchronized to the updating of eye position. When coupled to predictive eye position signals, remapping served to stabilize the target representation for continuously accurate pointing. Graded inactivations of pathways in the model replicated, and helped to interpret, previous in vivo experiments. The results support the hypothesis that visual stability requires presaccadic remapping, provide explanations for the function and timing of remapping, and offer testable hypotheses for in vivo studies. We conclude that remapping allows for seamless coordinate frame transformations and quick actions despite visual afferent lags. With visual remapping in place for behavior, it may be exploited for perceptual continuity.", "publication_location": "Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2016.00052", "citations": "3", "readership": "41", "tweets": "2", "news_mentions": " "},

Early routability prediction helps designers and tools perform preventive measures so that design rule violations can be avoided in a proactive manner. However, it is a huge challenge to have a predictor that is both accurate and fast. In this work, we study how to leverage convolutional neural network to address this challenge. The proposed method, called RouteNet, can either evaluate the overall routability of cell placement solutions without global routing or predict the locations of DRC (Design Rule Checking) hotspots. In both cases, large macros in mixed-size designs are taken into consideration. Experiments on benchmark circuits show that RouteNet can forecast overall routability with accuracy similar to that of global router while using substantially less runtime. For DRC hotspot prediction, RouteNet improves accuracy by 50% compared to global routing.

Building accurate protein force fields from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations is challenging due to the complexity of proteins and high computational costs of QM methods. In order to overcome these two difficulties, here we developed the residue-based systematic molecular fragmentation method to partition general proteins into only 20 types of amino acid dipeptides and one type of peptide bond at level 1. The total energy of proteins is the combination of the energies of these fragments. Each type of the fragments is then parametrized using neural network (NN) representation of the QM reference. Adopting NN representation can circumvent the limitation of the analytic form of classical molecular mechanics (MM) force fields. Using MM force fields as the baseline, our method adds NN representation of QM corrections at the length scale of amino acid dipeptides. We tested our force fields for both homogeneous and heterogeneous polypeptides. Energy and forces predicted by our force fields compare favorably with full QM calculations from tripeptides to decapeptides.

Training ended once the mean-squared error (MSE) between the ideal and reconstructed images converged to a minimum. After training, the ANN weights were held constant and could be used to reconstruct source distributions other than those used while training. In the absence of noise when only collimator effects were present, reconstruction of a Hoffman brain phantom had a 89% reduction in MSE compared to standard filtered backprojection. When collimator-and-attenuation and collimator-attenuation-and-scatter trials were tested against filtered backprojection with Chang attenuation compensation, the corresponding ANN reconstructions demonstrated 85% and 86% decreases in MSE, respectively. With noise present, and with standard noise reduction filters implemented prior to reconstruction, the ANN reconstructions displayed up to a 50% decrease in MSE compared to filtered backprojection reconstructions for 200,000 count data.

METHODS: A backpropagation ANN merged nine input features (age plus eight radiographic findings extracted by radiologists) to predict biopsy outcome as its output. The features were ranked, and more important ones were selected to produce an optimal subset of features. RESULTS: Given all nine features, the ANN performed with a receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (Az) of .95 +/- .01. Given only the four most important features, the ANN performed with an Az of .96 +/- .01. Although not significantly better than the ANN with all nine features, the ANN with the four optimized features was significantly better than expert radiologists' Az of .90 +/- .02 (p = .01). This four-feature ANN had a 95% sensitivity and an 81% specificity. For cases with calcifications, the radiologists' performance dropped to an Az of .85 +/- .04, whereas a specialized three-feature ANN performed significantly better with an Az of .95 +/- .02 (p = .02). CONCLUSION: Given only four input features, the ANN predicted biopsy outcome significantly better than did expert radiologists, who also had access to other radiographic and nonradiographic data.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data were analyzed from a Phase III trial in which patients with locally advanced SCCHN received hyperfractionated irradiation with or without concurrent cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Of the 116 randomized patients, 95 who had 2-year follow-up and all required data were evaluated. ANN and logistic regression (LR) models were constructed to predict 2-year total survival using round-robin cross-validation. A modified staging model was also examined. RESULTS: The best LR model used tumor size, nodal stage, and race to predict survival. The best ANN used nodal stage, tumor size, stage, and resectability, and hemoglobin. Treatment type did not predict 2-year survival and was not included in either model. Using the respective best feature sets, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) for the ANN was 0.78 +/- 0.05, showing more accurate overall performance than LR (Az = 0.67 +/- 0.05, p = 0.07). At 70% sensitivity, the ANN was 72% specific, while LR was 54% specific (p = 0.08). At 70% specificity, the ANN was 72% sensitive, while LR was 54% sensitive (p = 0.07). When both models used the five predictive variables best for an ANN, Az for LR decreased [Az = 0.61 +/- 0.06, p < 0.01 (ANN)]. The models performed equivalently when using the three variables best for LR. The best ANN also compared favorably with staging [Az = 0.60 +/- 0.07, p = 0.02 (ANN)].

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely investigated as some of the most promising solution for various computer vision tasks. However, CNNs introduce massive computing overhead due to their complex network computing flow, resulting in significantly reduced applicability and performance, especially in the mobile devices. Various optimization schemes have been proposed mainly based on both model compression and stacked external computing resources. While these schemes have been proven effective, methods which take into account mobile-specific context-aware optimization approaches have been largely overlooked. One such opportunity is the feasible CNN computing flow simplification to the under-test objects with distinguish features, which can be efficiently pre-analyzed inside the mobile sensor system. Hence, we propose VoCaM, a visualization oriented CNN acceleration framework on mobile devices for image classification tasks. VoCaM takes advantage of the mobile camera system, where the comprehensive pre-analysis can be conducted to reveal the color composition of the under-test images without incurring any additional overhead. Also, the visualization analysis of VoCaM reveals that, certain color-specific filters may have very trivial result impact when the under-test images have mismatching primary color components. Then a set of approximate computing methods is applied to these insignificant filters to replace the intensive convolutional operation, and greatly accelerate the computing process. With ignorable overhead, VoCaM can significantly optimize the computation load of the convolutional layers, with very small impact on the overall classification accuracy.", "publication_location": "Ieee/Acm International Conference on Computer Aided Design, Digest of Technical Papers, Iccad", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCAD.2017.8203864", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Additional activations occurred in the anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, temporo-occipital cortex in the middle and inferior temporal gyri, the supplementary motor area, and the cerebellum. Direct comparisons showed a nearly complete overlap in the location of activations resulting from the two tasks. However, the spatial priming task displayed a more pronounced rightward asymmetry of parietal activation, and a conjunction analysis showed that the area of posterior parietal cortex jointly activated by both tasks was more extensive in the right hemisphere. Furthermore, the posterior parietal and temporo-occipital activations were more pronounced in the task of endogenous attentional shifts. The results show that both exogenous (based on spatial priming) and endogenous (based on expectancy cueing) shifts of attention are subserved by a common network of cortical and subcortical regions.

A large number of algorithms have been proposed for automatic buried threat detection (BTD) in ground penetrating radar (GPR) data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved groundbreaking results on many recognition tasks. This success is due, in part, to their ability to automatically infer effective data representations (i.e., features) using training data. This capability however results in a high capacity model (i.e., many free parameters) that is difficult to train, and more prone to overfitting, than models employing hand-crafted feature designs. This drawback is pronounced when training data is relatively scarce, as is the case with GPR BTD. In this work we propose to combine the relative advantages of hand-crafted features, and CNNs, by constructing CNN architectures that closely emulate successful hand-crafted feature designs for GPR BTD. This makes it possible to apply supervised training to traditional hand-crafted features, allowing them to adapt to the unique characteristics of the GPR BTD problem. Simultaneously, this approach yields a much lower capacity CNN model that incorporates substantial prior research knowledge, making the model much easier to train. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach by designing a \"neural\" implementation of the popular histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) feature. The resulting neural HOG (NHOG) implementation is much smaller and easier to train than standard CNN architectures, and achieves superior detection performance compared to the un-trained HOG feature. In theory, neural implementations can be developed for many existing successful GPR BTD algorithms, potentially yielding similar benefits.", "publication_location": "Smart Structures and Materials 2005: Active Materials: Behavior and Mechanics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2305797", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Apart from the well-known link between cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, especially diabetes and hypertension, and cerebrovascular damage, elevated FGF23 is also postulated to be associated with cerebrovascular damage independently of CKD. Elevated FGF23 predisposes to vascular calcification and is associated with vascular stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in the general population with normal renal function. These factors may lead to microangiopathic changes in the brain, cumulative ischemia, and eventually to the loss of white matter fibers. The relationship between FGF23 and brain integrity in individuals without CKD has hitherto not been investigated. In this study, we aimed to determine the association between FGF23, and white matter integrity in a cohort of 50 participants with varying degrees of CV risk burden, using high resolution structural human brain connectomes constructed from MRI diffusion images. We observed that increased FGF23 was associated with axonal loss in the frontal lobe, leading to a fragmentation of white matter network organization. This study provides the first description of the relationship between elevated levels of FGF23, white matter integrity, and brain health.

Method and Materials: The database comprised 235 patients with lung cancer treated using radiotherapy (34 diagnosed with pneumonitis). The neural network was constructed using a unique algorithm that alternately grew and pruned it, starting from the smallest possible network, until a satisfactory solution was found. The weights and biases of the network were computed using the error back‐propagation approach. The network was tested using ten‐fold cross‐validation, wherein 1/10th of the data were tested, in turn, using the model built with the remaining 9/10th of the data. Results: The network was constructed with input features selected from dose and non‐dose variables. The selected input features were: lung volume receiving > 16 Gy (V16), mean lung dose, generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) for the exponent a=3.5, free expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), diffusion capacity of Carbon Monoxide (DLCO%), and whether or not the patient underwent chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy. With the exception of FEV1, all input features were found to be individually significant (p < 0.05). The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve for cross‐validated testing was 0.76 (sensitivity: 68%, specificity: 69%). To gauge the impact of non‐dose variables on model predictive capability, a second network was constructed with input features selected only from lung dose‐volume histogram variables. The area under the ROC curve for cross‐validation was 0.67 (sensitivity: 53%, specificity: 69%). The network constructed from dose and non‐dose variables was statistically superior (p=0.020), indicating that the addition of non‐dose features significantly improves the generalization capability of the network. Conclusions: The neural network constructed from dose and non‐dose variables can be used to prospectively predict radiotherapy‐induced pneumonitis and, thereby, appropriately alter radiotherapy plans to reduce this possibility. © 2007, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

The ability of the models to predict target motion given real‐time surrogate marker motion was verified using a dynamic phantom with a target moving according to motion profiles derived from patient respiratory data. Methods & Materials: Tumor motion profiles were derived using patient data and imported into CIRS Dynamic Thorax Phantom. The phantom was imaged with a 4‐slice CT scanner in cine mode. Surrogate marker motion from the phantom exterior was recorded simultaneously using Varian's RPM system. Neural networks were constructed to model relationships between target presence or absence at each slice location and external marker motion. The combined networks for each of the slice locations were used to predict target motion. To verify the ability of the models to infer target position from surrogate signal, additional scans were performed. Models were used to predict target motion from external marker signals and compared to the motion patterns imported into the phantom. Results: Five preliminary experiments were performed with motion patterns from different patients. The models performed well for two cases, predicting motion with average errors on the order of image resolution, 1.26 mm and 1.39 mm root mean squared errors (RMSEs). For motion patterns with large peak‐to‐peak displacements or highly irregular frequencies / amplitudes, the predictions were less accurate. Conclusion: A neural network based method has been developed for modeling internal target motion using external surrogate signals and unsorted cine CT images. Preliminary results indicate that the approach may be useful for some cases.

For airport security, this can be a significant issue as false alarms require additional time to be resolved by human operators, which impacts bag throughput and airport operations. Orthogonal techniques such as X-ray Diffraction Tomography (XRDT) using a coded aperture provide complementary chemical/molecular signatures that can be used to identify a target material. The combination of noisy signals, variability in the XRD form factors for the same material, and the lack of a comprehensive material library limits the classification performance of the correlation based methods.

Accurate localization of lung tumor in real time based on a single X-ray projection is of great interest to the tumor-tracking radiotherapy but is very challenging.

A CNN regression model was trained before treatment to recover the ill-conditioned nonlinear mapping from the single X-ray projection to the tumor motion. Novel intensity correction and data augmentation techniques were adopted to improve the model's robustness to the scatter and noise in the X-ray projection image. During treatment, the volumetric image and tumor position could be obtained by applying the CNN model on the acquired X-ray projection.

A technique using single x-ray projection based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) was recently developed which can achieve accurate tumor localization in real-time. However, this method was only validated at fixed gantry angles. In this study, an improved technique is developed to handle arbitrary gantry angles for rotational radiotherapy. To evaluate the highly complex relationship between x-ray projections at arbitrary angles and tumor motion, a special CNN was proposed. In this network, a binary region of interest (ROI) mask was applied on every extracted feature map. This avoids the overfitting problem due to gantry rotation by directing the network to neglect those irrelevant pixels whose intensity variation had nothing to do with breathing motion. In addition, an angle-dependent fully connection layer (ADFCL) was utilized to recover the mapping from extracted feature maps to tumor motion, which would vary with the gantry angles. The method was tested with images from 15 realistic patients and compared with a variant network of VGG, developed by Oxford University's Visual Geometry Group. The tumors were clearly visible on x-ray projections for five patients only. The average tumor localization error was under 1.8 mm and 1.0 mm in superior-inferior and lateral directions. For the other ten patients whose tumors were not clearly visible in the x-ray projection, a feature point localization error was computed to evaluate the proposed method, the mean value of which was no more than 1.5 mm and 1.0 mm in both directions for all patients. A tumor localization method for single x-ray projection at arbitrary angles based on a novel CNN was developed and validated in this study for real-time operation. This greatly expanded the applicability of the tumor localization framework to the rotation therapy.", "publication_location": "Phys Med Biol", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab66e4", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Unfortunately, existing sources of such information are dispersed, limited in geospatial resolution, and otherwise incomplete or publically unavailable. As result, we recently proposed a new approach for collecting such distributed PV information that relies on computer algorithms to automatically detect PV arrays in high resolution aerial imagery [1], Here we build on this work by investigating two machine learning algorithms for PV array detection: a Random Forest classifier (RF) [2] and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) [3]. We use the RF algorithm as a benchmark, or baseline, for comparison with a CNN model. The two models are developed and tested using a large collection of publicly available [4] aerial imagery, covering 135 km2, and including over 2,700 manually annotated distributed PV array locations.

The objective of this study was to rapidly screen multiple HA-PEG composite hydrogel formulations for an effect on matrix synthesis and behaviors of nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) cells of the intervertebral disc (IVD). A secondary objective was to apply artificial neural network analysis to identify relationships between HA-PEG composite hydrogel formulation parameters and biological outcome measures for each cell type of the IVD. Eight different hydrogels were developed from preparations of thiolated HA (HA-SH) and PEG vinylsulfone (PEG-VS) macromers, and used as substrates for NP and AF cell culture in vitro. Hydrogel mechanical properties ranged from 70 to 489kPa depending on HA molecular weight, and measures of matrix synthesis, metabolite consumption and production and cell morphology were obtained to study relationships to hydrogel parameters. Results showed that NP and AF cell numbers were highest upon the HA-PEG hydrogels formed from the lower-molecular-weight HA, with evidence of higher sulfated glycosaminoglycan production also upon lower-HA-molecular-weight composite gels.

{"title": "Estimating ground-level PM2.5 using micro-satellite images by a convolutional neural network and random forest approach", "authors": "Zheng, T; Bergin, MH; Hu, S; Miller, J; Carlson, DE", "published_date": "June 1, 2020", "doi": "10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.117451", "abstract": "© 2020 Elsevier Ltd PM2.5 poses a serious threat to public health, however its spatial concentrations are not well characterized due to the sparseness of regulatory air quality monitoring (AQM) stations. This motivates novel low-cost methods to estimate ground-level PM2.5 at a fine spatial resolution so that PM2.5 exposure in epidemiological research can be better quantified. Satellite-retrieved aerosol products are widely used to estimate the spatial distribution of ground-level PM2.5. However, these aerosol products can be subject to large uncertainties due to many approximations and assumptions made in multiple stages of their retrieval algorithms. Therefore, estimating ground-level PM2.5 directly from satellites (e.g. satellite images) by skipping the intermediate step of aerosol retrieval can potentially yield lower errors because it avoids retrieval error propagating into PM2.5 estimation and is desirable compared to current ground-level PM2.5 retrieval methods. Additionally, the spatial resolutions of estimated PM2.5 are usually constrained by those of the aerosol products and are currently largely at a comparatively coarse 1 km or greater resolution. Such coarse spatial resolutions are unable to support scientific studies that thrive on highly spatially-resolved PM2.5. These limitations have motivated us to devise a computer vision algorithm for estimating ground-level PM2.5 at a high spatiotemporal resolution by directly processing the global-coverage, daily, near real-time updated, 3 m/pixel resolution, three-band micro-satellite imagery of spatial coverages significantly smaller than 1 × 1 km (e.g., 200 × 200 m) available from Planet Labs. In this study, we employ a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to process the imagery by extracting image features that characterize the day-to-day dynamic changes in the built environment and more importantly the image colors related to aerosol loading, and a random forest (RF) regressor to estimate PM2.5 based on the extracted image features along with meteorological conditions. We conducted the experiment on 35 AQM stations in Beijing over a period of ~3 years from 2017 to 2019. We trained our CNN-RF model on 10,400 available daily images of the AQM stations labeled with the corresponding ground-truth PM2.5 and evaluated the model performance on 2622 holdout images. Our model estimates ground-level PM2.5 accurately at a 200 m spatial resolution with a mean absolute error (MAE) as low as 10.1 μg m−3 (equivalent to 23.7% error) and Pearson and Spearman r scores up to 0.91 and 0.90, respectively. Our trained CNN from Beijing is then applied to Shanghai, a similar urban area. By quickly retraining only RF but not CNN on the new Shanghai imagery dataset, our model estimates Shanghai 10 AQM stations' PM2.5 accurately with a MAE and both Pearson and Spearman r scores of 7.7 μg m−3 (18.6% error) and 0.85, respectively. The finest 200 m spatial resolution of ground-level PM2.5 estimates from our model in this study is higher than the vast majority of existing state-of-the-art satellite-based PM2.5 retrieval methods. And our 200 m model's estimation performance is also at the high end of these state-of-the-art methods. Our results highlight the potential of augmenting existing spatial predictors of PM2.5 with high-resolution satellite imagery to enhance the spatial resolution of PM2.5 estimates for a wide range of applications, including pollutant emission hotspot determination, PM2.5 exposure assessment, and fusion of satellite remote sensing and low-cost air quality sensor network information.", "publication_location": "Atmospheric Environment", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.117451", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": "1", "news_mentions": "7"},

However, the iterative deformable registration method used for deforming edges from planning-CT to on-board CBCT is time-consuming and user-dependent. This study aims to automate and accelerate PCTV reconstruction by developing an unsupervised CNN model to bypass the conventional deformable registration. Methods: The new method uses unsupervised CNN model for deformation prediction and PCTV reconstruction. An unsupervised CNN model with a u-net structure was used to predict deformation vector fields (DVF) to generate on-board contours for PCTV reconstruction. Paired 3D image volumes of prior CT and on-board CBCT are inputs and DVF are predicted without the need of ground truths. The model was initially trained on brain MRI images, and then fine-tuned using our lung SBRT data. This method was evaluated using lung SBRT patient data. In the intra-patient study, the first n-1 day's CBCTs are used for CNN training to predict nth day edge information (n = 2, 3, 4, 5). 45 half-fan projections covering 360˚ from nth day CBCT is used for reconstruction. In the inter-patient study, the 10 patient images including CT and first day's CBCT are used for training. Results from Edge-preserving (EPTV), PCTV and PCTV-CNN are compared. Results: The cross-correlations of the predicted edge map and the ground truth were on average 0.88 for both intra-patient and inter-patient studies. PCTV-CNN achieved comparable image quality as PCTV while automating the registration process and reducing the registration time from 1-2 min to 1.4 s.

Specifically, the processing units like GPUs, FPGAs, and customized ASICs, must wait for inputs to read from memory and outputs to write back. This motivates memristor-based neuromorphic computing in which the memory units (i.e., memristors) have computing capabilities. However, training a memristor-based neural network is difficult since memristors work differently from CMOS hardware. This paper proposes a new training approach that enables prevailing neural network training techniques to be applied for memristor-based neuromorphic networks. Particularly, we introduce momentum and adaptive learning rate to the circuit training, both of which are proven methods that significantly accelerate the convergence of neural network parameters.

This is a self-organizing (by growing) multiscale version of a radial basis function (RBF) network. It is constituted of hierarchical layers, each containing a Gaussian grid at a decreasing scale. The grids are not completely filled, but units are inserted only where the local error is over threshold. This guarantees a uniform residual error and the allocation of more units with smaller scales where the data contain higher frequencies. Only local operations, which do not require any iteration on the data, are required; this allows to construct the network in quasi-real time. Through harmonic analysis, it is demonstrated that, although a HRBF cannot be reduced to a traditional wavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA), it does employ Riesz bases and enjoys asymptotic approximation properties for a very large class of functions. HRBF networks have been extensively applied to the reconstruction of three-dimensional (3-D) models from noisy range data.

The prior knowledge, referred to as long-term memory (LTM), is expressed in the form of equality constraints obtained by means of an algebraic training technique. Incremental training, which may be used to learn new short-term memories (STMs) online, is then formulated as an error minimization problem subject to equality constraints. The solution of this problem is simplified by implementing an adjoined error gradient that circumvents direct substitution and exploits classical backpropagation. A target application is neural network function approximation in adaptive critic designs. For illustrative purposes, constrained training is implemented to update an adaptive critic flight controller, while preserving prior knowledge of an established performance baseline that consists of classical gain-scheduled controllers.

All of these problems can be solved via their convex relaxations which minimize the trace norm instead of the rank of the matrix, and have to be solved iteratively and involve singular value decomposition (SVD) at each iteration. Therefore, those algorithms for trace norm minimization problems suffer from high computation cost of multiple SVDs. In this paper, we propose an efficient Matrix Bi-Factorization (MBF) method to approximate the original trace norm minimization problem and mitigate the computation cost of performing SVDs. The proposed MBF method can be used to address a wide range of low-rank matrix recovery and completion problems such as low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition (LRSD), low-rank representation (LRR) and low-rank matrix completion (MC).

Despite their adaptive capabilities, neural controllers are often criticized for not providing the same performance and stability guarantees as classical linear designs. Therefore, this paper develops an algebraic synthesis procedure for designing dynamic output-feedback neural controllers that are closed-loop stable and meet the same performance objectives as any classical linear design. The performance synthesis problem is addressed by deriving implicit model-following algebraic relationships between model matrices, obtained from the classical design, and the neural control parameters. Additional linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) conditions for closed-loop exponential stability of the neural controller are derived using existing integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) for operators with repeated slope-restricted nonlinearities.

This model, called the Spectral Timing Model, controls a type of timing whereby an animal or robot can learn to wait for an expected goal by discounting expected nonoccurrences of a goal object until the expected time of arrival of the goal. If the goal object does not then materialize, the animal can respond to unexpected nonoccurrences of the goal with appropriate changes in information processing and exploratory behavior. The model is a variant of the gated dipole model of opponent processing. When the gated dipole model is generalized to include a spectrum of cellular response rates within a large population of cells, the model's total output signal generates accurate learned timing properties that collectively provide a good quantitative fit to animal learning data. In particular, the Spectral Timing Model utilizes the habituative transmitter gates and adaptive long-term memory traces that are characteristic of gated dipole models. The Spectral Timing Model is embedded into an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural architecture for the learning of correlations between internal representations of recognition codes and reinforcement codes. This type of learning is called conditioned reinforcer learning. The two types of internal representations are called sensory representations (S) and drive representations (D). Activation of a drive representation D by the Spectral Timing Model inhibits output signals from the orienting subsystem (A) of the ART architecture and activates a motor response. The inhibitory pathway helps to prevent spurious resets of short-term memory, forgetting, and orienting responses from being caused by events other than the goal object prior to the expected arrival time of the goal. Simulated data properties include the inverted U in learning as a function of the interstimulus interval (ISI) that occurs between onset of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the unconditioned stimulus (US); correlations of peak time, standard deviation, Weber fraction, and peak amplitude of the conditioned response as a function of the ISI; increase of conditioned response amplitude, but not its timing, with US intensity; speed-up of the timing circuit by an increase in CS intensity or by drugs that increase concentrations of brain dopamine or acetylcholine; multiple timing peaks in response to learning conditions using multiple ISIs; and conditioned timing of cell activation within the hippocampus and of the contingent negative variation (CNV) event-related potential. The results on speed-up by drugs that increase brain concentrations of dopamine and acetylcholine support a 1972 prediction that the gated dipole habituative transmitter is a catecholamine and its long-term memory trace transmitter is acetylcholine.

While the number of interconnections which may be stored in a volume hologram scales as the volume of the system, N3, the number of optical beams which may be used to record holograms scales as the area enclosing the system, N2.

Individuals with autistic spectrum disorders exhibit distinct personality traits linked to attentional, social, and affective functions, and those traits are expressed with varying levels of severity in the neurotypical and subclinical population.

Yet, it remains unclear whether reduced synchrony between these neural networks contributes to autistic traits. To investigate this issue, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to record brain activation while neurotypical participants who varied in their subclinical scores on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) viewed alternating blocks of social and nonsocial stimuli (i.e., images of faces and of landscape scenes). We used independent component analysis (ICA) combined with a spatiotemporal regression to quantify synchrony between neural networks. Our results indicated that decreased synchrony between the executive control network (ECN) and a face-scene network (FSN) predicted higher scores on the AQ.

Memristors can remember the historical profiles of the excitations and record them as analog variables. The similarity to biological synaptic behavior has encouraged a lot of research on memristor-based neuromorphic hardware system. In this work, we explore the potential of a memristor crossbar array as an auto-associative memory. More specifically, the recall function of a multi-answer character recognition based on BSB model was realized. The robustness of the proposed BSB circuit was analyzed and evaluated based on massive Monte-Carlo simulations, considering input defects, process variations, and electrical fluctuations. The physical constraints when implementing a neural network with memristor crossbar array have also been discussed. Our results show that the BSB circuit has a high tolerance to random noise. Comparably, the correlations between memristor arrays introduce directional noise and hence dominate the quality of the circuit. © 2012 IEEE.", "publication_location": "Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252563", "citations": "40", "readership": "53", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The approach taken is to design nonlinear control systems that take advantage of prior knowledge and experience gained from linear controllers, while capitalizing on the broader capabilities of adaptive, nonlinear control theory and computational neural networks. Central to this novel approach is the recognition that the gradients of a nonlinear control law must represent the gain matrices of an equivalent, locally linearized controller.

SVMs can always be trained to provide global minima, given that the leaning machine parameters are optimally computed. The current most prevalent methods to select these parameters are numerical iterative techniques. While useful, these methods frequently have no basis in theory, and cannot guarantee that the resultant parameters will yield optimum learning machine performance. The purpose of this paper is to discuss and demonstrate the application of Evolutionary Programming (EP) concepts to develop learning machine parameters and demonstrate the effectiveness of this process. This paper will also demonstrate that the applied EP process will reduce the amount of time required to configure a learning machine for those data sets studied, while developing optimal learning parameters with minimal user intervention. Specifically, this research has demonstrated, using the Duke mammogram data set, that SVMs derived using this modified EP process improved the specificity by a significant 45.3% at 100% sensitivity (missing no cancers) as well as improving the specificity by 17.5% at 95% sensitivity (missing 5% of the cancers) when compared to the performance of SVMs whose parameters were computed using the standard iterative method. The practical consequence of these results is that many women, who currently have false positive diagnoses resulting from the application of existing methods, will no longer be required to undergo biopsy with the resultant cost, morbidity and physical disfigurement that frequently results from these procedures.

Due to the multiscale nature of the medium,the fine-grid resolution gives rise to a huge number of degrees of freedom. Inpractice, low-order models are derived to reduce the computational cost. In ourpaper, we use a non-local multicontinuum (NLMC) approach, which represents thesolution on a coarse grid [18]. Using multi-layer learning techniques, weformulate and learn input-output maps constructed with NLMC on a coarse grid.We study the features of the coarse-grid solutions that neural networks capturevia relating the input-output optimization to $l_1$ minimization of PDEsolutions. In proposed multi-layer networks, we can learn the forward operatorsin a reduced way without computing them as in POD like approaches. We presentsoft thresholding operators as activation function, which our studies show tohave some advantages. With these activation functions, the neural networkidentifies and selects important multiscale features which are crucial inmodeling the underlying flow. Using trained neural network approximation of theinput-output map, we construct a reduced-order model for the solutionapproximation. We use multi-layer networks for the time stepping andreduced-order modeling, where at each time step the appropriate important modesare selected.

Several algorithms have been proposed for training spiking neural networksthrough biologically-plausible learning mechanisms, such as spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticityand Hebbian plasticity. These algorithms typically rely on the ability to update the synaptic strengths,or weights, directly, through a weight update rule in which the weight increment can be decidedand implemented based on the training equations. However, in several potential applications ofadaptive spiking neural networks, including neuroprosthetic devices and CMOS/memristor nanoscaleneuromorphic chips, the weights cannot be manipulated directly and, instead, tend to change over timeby virtue of the pre- and postsynaptic neural activity. This paper presents an indirect learning methodthat induces changes in the synaptic weights by modulating spike-timing-dependent plasticity by meansof controlled input spike trains. In place of the weights, the algorithm manipulates the input spike trainsused to stimulate the input neurons by determining a sequence of spike timings that minimize a desiredobjective function and, indirectly, induce the desired synaptic plasticity in the network.", "publication_location": "Advances in Artificial Neural Systems", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2012/713581", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

To understand the success of SGDfor training deep neural networks, this work presents a mean-field analysis ofdeep residual networks, based on a line of works that interpret the continuumlimit of the deep residual network as an ordinary differential equation whenthe network capacity tends to infinity. Specifically, we propose a newcontinuum limit of deep residual networks, which enjoys a good landscape in thesense that every local minimizer is global. This characterization enables us toderive the first global convergence result for multilayer neural networks inthe mean-field regime. Furthermore, without assuming the convexity of the losslandscape, our proof relies on a zero-loss assumption at the global minimizerthat can be achieved when the model shares a universal approximation property.Key to our result is the observation that a deep residual network resembles ashallow network ensemble, i.e. a two-layer network. We bound the differencebetween the shallow network and our ResNet model via the adjoint sensitivitymethod, which enables us to apply existing mean-field analyses of two-layernetworks to deep networks.

Memristor-based crossbars have been applied successfully to accelerate vector-matrix computations in deep neural networks. During the training process of neural networks, the conductances of the memristors in the crossbars must be updated repetitively. However, memristors can only be programmed reliably for a given number of times. Afterwards, the working ranges of the memristors deviate from the fresh state. As a result, the weights of the corresponding neural networks cannot be implemented correctly and the classification accuracy drops significantly. This phenomenon is called aging, and it limits the lifetime of memristor-based crossbars. In this paper, we propose a co-optimization framework combining software training and hardware mapping to reduce the aging effect. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can extend the lifetime of such crossbars up to 11 times, while the expected accuracy of classification is maintained.", "publication_location": "Proceedings of the 2019 Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition, Date 2019", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/DATE.2019.8714954", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Activation or suppression of neural networks could theoretically be assessed by either clinical symptom modification (ie, tremor, rigidity, seizures) or development of specific biomarkers linked to treatment of symptomatic disease states. For example, biomarkers indicative of disease state could aid improved intraoperative localization of electrode position, optimize device efficacy or efficiency through dynamic control, and eventually serve to guide automatic adjustment of stimulation settings. Biomarkers to control either extracranial or intracranial stimulation span from continuous physiological brain activity, intermittent pathological activity, and triggered local phenomena or potentials, to wearable devices, blood flow, biochemical or cardiac signals, temperature perturbations, optical or magnetic resonance imaging changes, or optogenetic signals. The goal of this review is to update new approaches to implement control of stimulation through relevant biomarkers. Critical questions include whether adaptive systems adjusted through biomarkers can optimize efficiency and eventually efficacy, serve as inputs for stimulation adjustment, and consequently broaden our fundamental understanding of abnormal neural networks in pathologic states.

Our analyses revealed systematic state-dependent functional connectivity in one brain region: the precuneus.

The absolute magnitude of this effect was greater for DMN, suggesting a heightened specialization for resting-state cognition. All results replicated within the two independent samples.

METHOD: Twelve children and adolescents with ASD and 12 typically developing (TD) controls matched faces by emotion and assigned a label to facial expressions while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Both groups engaged similar neural networks during facial emotion processing, including activity in the fusiform gyrus (FG) and prefrontal cortex. However, between-group analyses in regions of interest revealed that when matching facial expressions, the ASD group showed significantly less activity than the TD group in the FG, but reliably greater activity in the precuneus. During the labeling of facial emotions, no between-group differences were observed at the behavioral or neural level. Furthermore, activity in the amygdala was moderated by task demands in the TD group but not in the ASD group.

They consider how the modulation depth of each grating (or equivalently the strength of each connection) can be controlled through the implementation of learning algorithms.

To directly compare the brain regions engaged by these two cognitive functions, the same set of subjects consecutively participated in tasks of working memory and spatial attention while undergoing functional MRI (fMRI). The working memory task required the subject to maintain an on-line representation of foveally displayed letters against a background of distracters. The spatial attention task required the subject to shift visual attention covertly in response to a centrally presented directional cue. The spatial attention task had no working memory requirement, and the working memory task had no covert spatial attention requirement. Subjects' ability to maintain central fixation was confirmed outside the MRI scanner using infrared oculography. According to cognitive conjunction analysis, the set of activations common to both tasks included the intraparietal sulcus, ventral precentral sulcus, supplementary motor area, frontal eye fields, thalamus, cerebellum, left temporal neocortex, and right insula. Double-subtraction analyses yielded additional activations attributable to verbal working memory in premotor cortex, left inferior prefrontal cortex, right inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, and right cerebellum. Additional activations attributable to covert spatial attention included the occipitotemporal junction and extrastriate cortex. The use of two different tasks in the same set of subjects allowed us to provide an unequivocal demonstration that the neural networks subserving spatial attention and working memory intersect at several frontoparietal sites.

First, a prediction model (or adaptive neural network) is developed to infer target position from its former positions. For both internal target and external marker motion, two networks with the same type are created. Next, a linear model is established to correlate the prediction errors of both neural networks. Based on this, the prediction error of an internal target position can be reconstructed by the linear combination of the prediction errors of the external markers. Finally, the next position of the internal target is estimated by the network and subsequently corrected by the reconstructed prediction error. In a similar way, future positions are inferred as their previous positions are predicted and corrected. This method was examined by clinical data. The results demonstrated that an improvement (10% on average) of correlation between predicted signal and real internal motion was achieved, in comparison with the correlation between external markers and internal target motion.

Assessing the presence and severity of cataracts is essential for diagnosis and progression monitoring, as well as to facilitate clinical research and management of the disease. METHODS: Existing automatic methods for cataract grading utilize a predefined set of image features that may provide an incomplete, redundant, or even noisy representation. In this study, we propose a system to automatically learn features for grading the severity of nuclear cataracts from slit-lamp images. Local filters are first acquired through clustering of image patches from lenses within the same grading class. The learned filters are fed into a convolutional neural network, followed by a set of recursive neural networks, to further extract higher order features. With these features, support vector regression is applied to determine the cataract grade. RESULTS: The proposed system is validated on a large population-based dataset of [Formula: see text] images, where it outperforms the state of the art by yielding with respect to clinical grading a mean absolute error ( ε) of 0.304, a 70.7% exact integral agreement ratio ( R0), an 88.4% decimal grading error ≤ 0.5 ( Re0.5 ), and a 99.0% decimal grading error ≤ 1.0 ( Re1.0 ).

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently drawn tremendous attention in many artificial intelligence (AI) applications including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. While GANs deliver state-of-the-art performance on these AI tasks, it comes at the cost of high computational complexity. Although recent progress demonstrated the promise of using ReRMA-based Process-In-Memory for acceleration of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with low energy cost, the unique training process required by GANs makes them difficult to run on existing neural network acceleration platforms: two competing networks are simultaneously cotrained in GANs, and hence, significantly increasing the need of memory and computation resources. In this work, we propose ReGAN - a novel ReRAM-based Process-In-Memory accelerator that can efficiently reduce off-chip memory accesses. Moreover, ReGAN greatly increases system throughput by pipelining the layer-wise computation. Two techniques, namely, Spatial Parallelism and Computation Sharing are particularly proposed to further enhance training efficiency of GANs.

Motivated by these experimental facts, modeling studies have investigated mechanisms for the emergence of coherent activity in networks of inhibitory neurons. However, most of these studies have focused either when the noise in the network is absent or weak or in the opposite situation when it is strong. Hence, a full picture of how noise affects the dynamics of such systems is still lacking. The aim of this letter is to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which the asynchronous states in large, fully connected networks of inhibitory neurons are destabilized as a function of the noise level. Three types of single neuron models are considered: the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model, the exponential integrate-and-fire (EIF), model and conductance-based models involving sodium and potassium Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) currents. We show that in all models, the instabilities of the asynchronous state can be classified in two classes. The first one consists of clustering instabilities, which exist in a restricted range of noise. These instabilities lead to synchronous patterns in which the population of neurons is broken into clusters of synchronously firing neurons. The irregularity of the firing patterns of the neurons is weak. The second class of instabilities, termed oscillatory firing rate instabilities, exists at any value of noise. They lead to cluster state at low noise. As the noise is increased, the instability occurs at larger coupling, and the pattern of firing that emerges becomes more irregular. In the regime of high noise and strong coupling, these instabilities lead to stochastic oscillations in which neurons fire in an approximately Poisson way with a common instantaneous probability of firing that oscillates in time.", "publication_location": "Neural Computation", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/089976606776241048", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Neuroimaging studies suggest that older adults may compensate for declines in brain function and cognition through reorganization of neural resources. A limitation of prior research is reliance on between-group comparisons of neural activation (e.g., younger vs. older), which cannot be used to assess compensatory ability quantitatively. It is also unclear about the relationship between compensatory ability with cognitive function or how other factors such as physical exercise modulates compensatory ability. Here, we proposed a data-driven method to semi-quantitatively measure neural compensation under a challenging cognitive task, and we then explored connections between neural compensation to cognitive engagement and cognitive reserve (CR). Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired for 26 healthy older adults during a face-name memory task. Spatial independent component analysis (ICA) identified visual, attentional and left executive as core networks. Results show that the smaller the volumes of the gray matter (GM) structures within core networks, the more networks were needed to conduct the task (r = -0.408, p = 0.035). Therefore, the number of task-activated networks controlling for the GM volume within core networks was defined as a measure of neural compensatory ability. We found that compensatory ability correlated with working memory performance (r = 0.528, p = 0.035). Among subjects with good memory task performance, those with higher CR used fewer networks than subjects with lower CR. Among poor-performance subjects, those using more networks had higher CR.

In previous work, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme was developed that used local histogram analysis of overlapping subimages and a fuzzy rule-based classifier to segment individual microcalcifications, and clustering analysis for reducing the number of false positive clusters. The performance of this previous CAD scheme depended on a large number of parameters such as the intervals used to calculate fuzzy membership values and on the combination of membership values used by each decision rule. These parameters were optimized empirically based on the performance of the algorithm on the training set. In order to overcome the limitations of manual training and rule generation, the segmentation algorithm was modified in order to incorporate automatic parameter optimization. For the segmentation of individual microcalcifications, the new algorithm used a neural network with fuzzy-scaled inputs. The fuzzy-scaled inputs were created by processing the histogram features with a family of membership functions, the parameters of which were automatically extracted from the distribution of the feature values. The neural network was trained to classify feature vectors as either positive or negative. Individual microcalcifications were segmented from positive subimages. After clustering, another neural network was trained to eliminate false positive clusters. A database of 98 images provided training and testing sets to optimize the parameters and evaluate the CAD scheme, respectively. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated with a FROC analysis. At a sensitivity rate of 93.2%, there was an average of 0.8 false positive clusters per image. The results are very comparable with those taken using our previously published rule-based method. However, the new algorithm is more suited to generalize its performance on a larger population, depends on two monotonic outputs making its evaluation much easier and can be trained in an automatic way making practical its application on a large database.", "publication_location": "Medical Physics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1118/1.1460874", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

These dynamic properties of neuronal responses are mediated by ion channels that are subject to modulation. We demonstrate here how a neural network with recurrent feedback connections can convert long-term modulation of neural responses that occur over these intermediate timescales into changes in the amplitude of the steady output from the system. This general principle may be relevant to many feedback systems in the brain. Here it is applied to the vestibulo-ocular reflex, whose amplitude is subject to long-term adaptive modification by visual inputs.

We show that it performs remarkably well in a model neuron with binary synapses, and a finite number of \"hidden\" states per synapse, that has to learn a random classification task. Such a system is able to learn a number of associations close to the theoretical limit in time that is sublinear in system size. This is to our knowledge the first on-line algorithm that is able to achieve efficiently a finite number of patterns learned per binary synapse. Furthermore, we show that performance is optimal for a finite number of hidden states that becomes very small for sparse coding. The algorithm is similar to the standard \"perceptron\" learning algorithm, with an additional rule for synaptic transitions that occur only if a currently presented pattern is \"barely correct.\" In this case, the synaptic changes are metaplastic only (change in hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the synapse in its current state.

In an experiment, the non-ideal behaviour of the logic gates prevents the ultraviolet catastrophe and may lead to deterministic chaos. We identify certain non-ideal features of real logic gates that enable chaos in experimental networks. We find that short-pulse rejection and asymmetry between the logic states tend to engender periodic behaviour, at least for the simplest networks.

While neural compensation as a key component of cognitive reserve is an important factor that mediates cognitive decline, the field lacks a quantitative measure of neural compensatory ability, and little is known about factors that may modify compensation, such as physical exercise. METHODS: Twenty-five healthy older adults participated in a 6-week dance training exercise program. Gait speed, cognitive function, and functional magnetic resonance imaging during a challenging memory task were measured before and after the exercise program. In this study, we used a newly proposed data-driven independent component analysis approach to measure neural compensatory ability and tested the effect of physical exercise on neural compensation through a longitudinal study. RESULTS: After the exercise program, participants showed significantly improved memory performance in Logical Memory Test (WMS(LM)) (P < .001) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (P = .001) and increased gait speed measured by the 6-minute walking test (P = .01). Among all identified neural networks, only the motor cortices and cerebellum showed greater involvement during the memory task after exercise. Importantly, subjects who activated the motor network only after exercise (but not before exercise) showed WMS(LM) increases.

By varying the stimulus form and contrast for the initiation of smooth pursuit eye movements in monkeys, we show that visual motion inputs compete with two independent priors: one prior biases eye speed toward zero; the other prior attracts eye direction according to the past several days' history of target directions. The priors bias the speed and direction of the initiation of pursuit for the weak sensory data provided by the motion of a low-contrast sine wave grating. However, the priors have relatively little effect on pursuit speed and direction when the visual stimulus arises from the coherent motion of a high-contrast patch of dots. For any given stimulus form, the mean and variance of eye speed covary in the initiation of pursuit, as expected for signal-dependent noise. This relationship suggests that pursuit implements a trade-off between movement accuracy and variation, reducing both when the sensory signals are noisy. The tradeoff is implemented as a competition of sensory data and priors that follows the rules of Bayesian estimation. Computer simulations show that the priors can be understood as direction-specific control of the strength of visual-motor transmission, and can be implemented in a neural-network model that makes testable predictions about the population response in the smooth eye movement region of the frontal eye fields.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1163-12.2012", "citations": "29", "readership": "110", "tweets": "7", "news_mentions": " "},

The performance of a LSM neural network model on pattern recognition tasks mainly depends on its parameter settings. Two parameters are of particular interest: the distribution of synaptic strengths and synaptic connectivity. To design an efficient liquid filter that performs desired kernel functions, these parameters need to be optimized. We have studied performance as a function of these parameters for several models of synaptic connectivity. The results show that in order to achieve good performance, large synaptic weights are required to compensate for a small number of synapses in the liquid filter, and vice versa. In addition, a larger variance of the synaptic weights results in better performance for LSM benchmark problems. We also propose a genetic algorithm-based approach to evolve the liquid filter from a minimum structure with no connections, to an optimized kernel with a minimal number of synapses and high classification accuracy.

In addition, since the NAc contains several cell types, it is not known if each type participates in the transitions associated with feeding and sleep. Such knowledge is important for understanding the interaction between two different neural networks. For these reasons we recorded ensembles of NAc neurons while individual rats volitionally transitioned between the following states: awake and goal directed, feeding, quiet-awake, and sleeping. We found that during both feeding and sleep states, the same neurons could increase their activity (be activated) or decrease their activity (be inactivated) by feeding and/or during sleep, thus indicating that the vast majority of NAc neurons integrate sleep and feeding signals arising from spatially distinct neural networks. In contrast, a smaller population was modulated by only one of the states. For the majority of neurons in either state, we found that when one population was excited, the other was inhibited, suggesting that they act as a local circuit.

Subsequently, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned on manual labels to rectify errors in auxiliary labels. With this learning strategy, we are able to use large neuroimaging repositories without manual annotations for training. In an extensive set of evaluations on eight datasets that cover a wide age range, pathology, and different scanners, we demonstrate that QuickNAT achieves superior segmentation accuracy and reliability in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, while being orders of magnitude faster. The speed up facilitates processing of large data repositories and supports translation of imaging biomarkers by making them available within seconds for fast clinical decision making.", "publication_location": "Neuroimage", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.11.042", "citations": "33", "readership": "116", "tweets": "21", "news_mentions": " "},

Specific treatment mechanisms underlying therapeutic brain stimulation remain unclear, in spite of the demonstrated efficacy in a number of nervous system diseases. Brain stimulation appears to exert widespread influence over specific neural networks that are relevant to specific disease entities. In awake patients, activation or suppression of these neural networks can be assessed by either symptom alleviation (i.e., tremor, rigidity, seizures) or physiological criteria, which may be predictive of expected symptomatic treatment. Secondary verification of network activation through specific biomarkers that are linked to symptomatic disease improvement may be useful for several reasons. For example, these biomarkers could aid optimal intraoperative localization, possibly improve efficacy or efficiency (i.e., reduced power needs), and provide long-term adaptive automatic adjustment of stimulation parameters. Possible biomarkers for use in portable or implanted devices span from ongoing physiological brain activity, evoked local field potentials (LFPs), and intermittent pathological activity, to wearable devices, biochemical, blood flow, optical, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes, temperature changes, or optogenetic signals. First, however, potential biomarkers must be correlated directly with symptom or disease treatment and network activation. Although numerous biomarkers are under consideration for a variety of stimulation indications the feasibility of these approaches has yet to be fully determined. Particularly, there are critical questions whether the use of adaptive systems can improve efficacy over continuous stimulation, facilitate adjustment of stimulation interventions and improve our understanding of the role of abnormal network function in disease mechanisms.", "publication_location": "Frontiers in Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2017.00564", "citations": "22", "readership": "131", "tweets": "10", "news_mentions": "41"},

We used 924 digitized chest images (992 noncalcified nodules) which had a 500 x 500 matrix size with a 1024 gray scale. The images were divided randomly into two sets which were used for training and testing of the computerized scheme. In this scheme, the lung field was first segmented by use of a ribcage detection technique, and then a large search area (448 x 448 matrix size) within the chest image was automatically determined by taking into account the locations of a midline and a top edge of the segmented ribcage. In order to detect lung nodule candidates based on a localized search method, we divided the entire search area into 7 x 7 regions of interest (ROIs: 64 x 64 matrix size). In the next step, each ROI was classified anatomically into apical, peripheral, hilar, and diaphragm/heart regions by use of its image features. Identification of lung nodule candidates and extraction of image features were applied for each localized region (128 x 128 matrix size), each having its central part (64 x 64 matrix size) located at a position corresponding to a ROI that was classified anatomically in the previous step. Initial candidates were identified by use of the nodule-enhanced image obtained with the average radial-gradient filtering technique, in which the filter size was varied adaptively depending on the location and the anatomical classification of the ROI. We extracted 57 image features from the original and nodule-enhanced images based on geometric, gray-level, background structure, and edge-gradient features. In addition, 14 image features were obtained from the corresponding locations in the contralateral subtraction image. A total of 71 image features were employed for three sequential artificial neural networks (ANNs) in order to reduce the number of false-positive candidates. All parameters for ANNs, i.e., the number of iterations, slope of sigmoid functions, learning rate, and threshold values for removing the false positives, were determined automatically by use of a bootstrap technique with training cases. We employed four different combinations of training and test image data sets which was selected randomly from the 924 cases. By use of our localized search method based on anatomical classification, the average sensitivity was increased to 92.5% with 59.3 false positives per image at the level of initial detection for four different sets of test cases, whereas our previous technique achieved an 82.8% of sensitivity with 56.8 false positives per image. The computer performance in the final step obtained from four different data sets indicated that the average sensitivity in detecting lung nodules was 70.1% with 5.0 false positives per image for testing cases and 70.4% sensitivity with 4.2 false positives per image for training cases.

In CAD schemes, classifiers play a key role in achieving a high lesion detection rate and a low false-positive rate. Although many popular classifiers such as linear discriminant analysis and artificial neural networks have been employed in CAD schemes for reduction of false positives, a rule-based classifier has probably been the simplest and most frequently used one since the early days of development of various CAD schemes. However, with existing rule-based classifiers, there are major disadvantages that significantly reduce their practicality and credibility. The disadvantages include manual design, poor reproducibility, poor evaluation methods such as resubstitution, and a large overtraining effect. An automated rule-based classifier with a minimized overtraining effect can overcome or significantly reduce the extent of the above-mentioned disadvantages. In this study, we developed an \"optimal\" method for the selection of cutoff thresholds and a fully automated rule-based classifier. Experimental results performed with Monte Carlo simulation and a real lung nodule CT data set demonstrated that the automated threshold selection method can completely eliminate overtraining effect in the procedure of cutoff threshold selection, and thus can minimize overall overtraining effect in the constructed rule-based classifier. We believe that this threshold selection method is very useful in the construction of automated rule-based classifiers with minimized overtraining effect.", "publication_location": "Medical Physics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1118/1.1999126", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Our database consisted of 55 chest radiographs (33 primary lung cancers and 22 benign nodules). In this method, the location of a nodule was indicated first by a radiologist. The difference image with a nodule was produced by use of filters and then represented in a polar coordinate system. The nodule was segmented automatically by analysis of contour lines of the gray-level distribution based on the polar-coordinate representation. Two clinical parameters (age and sex) and 75 image features were determined from the outline, the image, and histogram analysis for inside and outside regions of the segmented nodule. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and knowledge about benign and malignant nodules were used to select initial feature combinations. Many combinations for subgroups of 77 features were evaluated as input to artificial neural networks (ANNs). The performance of ANNs with the selected 7 features by use of the round-robin test showed Az = 0.872, which was greater than Az = 0.854 obtained previously with the manual method (P= 0.53).

The areas that included specific diffuse patterns in 315 HRCT images were marked by three radiologists independently on the CRT monitor in the same manner as they commonly describe in their radiologic reports. The areas with a specific pattern, which three radiologists marked independently and consistently as the same patterns, were used as \"gold standard\" for specific abnormal opacities in this study. The lungs were first segmented from the background in each slice by use of a morphological filter and a thresholding technique, and then divided into many contiguous regions of interest (ROIs) with a 32x32 matrix. Six physical measures which were determined in each ROI included the mean and the standard deviation of the CT value, air density components, nodular components, line components, and multilocular components. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were employed for distinguishing between seven different patterns which included normals and six patterns associated with diffuse lung disease. The sensitivity of this computerized method for a detection of the six abnormal patterns in each ROI was 99.2% (122/123) for ground-glass opacities, 100% (15/15) for reticular and linear opacities, 88.0% (132/150) for nodular opacities, 100% (98/98) for honeycombing, 95.8% (369/385) for emphysematous change, and 100% (43/43) for consolidation.

OBJECTIVE: To identify, using fMRI, brain regions involved in processing written text in children. METHODS: The authors studied nine normal right-handed native English-speaking children, aged 10.2 years (range 7.9 to 13.3 years), with two paradigms: reading Aesop's Fables and \"Read Response Naming\" (reading a description of an object that was then silently named). Data were acquired using blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI. Group data were analyzed with statistical parametric mapping; individual data sets were analyzed with a region-of-interest approach from individual study t maps. The number of activated pixels was determined in brain regions and an asymmetry index (AI = [L - R]/[L + R]) calculated for each region. RESULTS: The authors found strong activation in the left middle temporal gyrus and left midfrontal gyrus and variable activation in left inferior frontal gyrus for both reading tasks in the group analysis (z > 5.5 to 9.1). All subjects had strong left-sided lateralization for both tasks in middle/superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, and middle frontal gyrus (AI = 0.76 to 1.0 for t = 4). Reading Fables activated twice as many pixels in temporal cortex as the Read Response Naming task; activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was similar for both tasks. Small homologous right middle temporal region activation was seen with reading a fable. CONCLUSIONS: The neural networks that process reading appear to be lateralized and localized by middle to late childhood.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly applied to multi-channel image data by matching the number of network input channels to the number of data channels, learning explicit relationships between channels. This provides a high degree of specificity to a particular problem, but may fail to generalize to a broader class of closely related problems. We propose a solution to this generalization problem in the context of spectral x-ray CT, where the scanning kVps (energy bins) and contrast are often variable. Specifically, we propose a novel CNN architecture which handles variable numbers of input channels, variable noise levels between channels, and variable modes of spectral contrast.

To automatically segment the tumors in each patient, we trained three CNNs: (a) one using data for patients from the same institution as the test data, (b) one using data for the patients from the other institution and (c) one using data for the patients from both of the institutions. The performance of the trained models was evaluated using Dice similarity coefficients as well as Average Hausdorff Distance between the ground truth and automatic segmentations. The 10-fold cross-validation scheme was used to compare the performance of different approaches. RESULTS: Performance of the model significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) when it was trained on data from a different institution (dice coefficients: 0.68 ± 0.19 and 0.59 ± 0.19) as compared to training with data from the same institution (dice coefficients: 0.72 ± 0.17 and 0.76 ± 0.12). This trend persisted for segmentation of the entire tumor as well as its individual components. CONCLUSIONS: There is a very strong effect of selecting data for training on performance of CNNs in a multi-institutional setting.

In this work, we study the effect of combining 4 different models (Decision_Trees, Neural_Networks, Support_Vector_Machines, Self_Organizing_Maps) to predict for radiation‐induced pneumonitis. Method and Materials: The four models were built from a database of 219 lung cancer patients who underwent thoracic radiotherapy at our institution. Each model was built by independently selecting a small number of features from the list of all available variables; no two models had all features in common. To gauge variance in the model predictions of pneumonitis, 100 predictions per model were generated for each patient (predictions were from model versions built using randomly chosen subsets of the remaining patients). The results were fused by simple averaging of the predictions from all four models. Results: The low inter‐model correlations between the patient predictions from the four models indicated differences in opinion (Pearson correlation range = 0.18 – 0.59, Spearman rank‐correlation range = 0.19 – 0.63). Fusion improved predictive capability over any of the component models. For example, randomly fusing 5 of the 100 predictions from each of the 4 models yielded a Receiver Operating Characteristics area of 0.79 (95% interval: 0.77 – 0.80) compared to: 0.74 (0.70 – 0.77) for Neural_Networks, 0.70 (0.68 – 0.72) for Decision_Trees, 0.75 (0.68 – 0.79) for Support_Vector_Machines, and 0.72 (0.69 – 0.75) for Self_Organizing_Maps. The following three sets of consensus features were extracted as those that most influenced all four models in predicting radiation‐pneumonitis: (1) chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy; (2) EUD for exponent a = 1.2 to 3; (3) EUD for a = 0.5 to 1.2 & lung volume > 20 – 30 Gy.

Fusion has been shown to be most effective when the models have some complementary strengths arising from different approaches. In this work, we fuse the results from four common but methodologically different nonlinear multivariate models (Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Self-Organizing Maps) that were trained to predict radiation-induced pneumonitis risk on a database of 219 lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy (34 with Grade 2+ postradiotherapy pneumonitis). Each model independently incorporated a small number of features from the available set of dose and nondose patient variables to predict pneumonitis; no two models had all features in common. Fusion was achieved by simple averaging of the predictions for each patient from all four models. Since a model's prediction for a patient can be dependent on the patient training set used to build the model, the average of several different predictions from each model was used in the fusion (predictions were made by repeatedly testing each patient with a model built from different cross-validation training sets that excluded the patient being tested). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the fused cross-validated results was 0.79, with lower variance than the individual component models. From the fusion, five features were extracted as the consensus among all four models in predicting radiation pneumonitis. Arranged in order of importance, the features are (1) chemotherapy; (2) equivalent uniform dose (EUD) for exponent a=1.2 to 3; (3) EUD for a=0.5 to 1.2, lung volume receiving >20-30 Gy; (4) female sex; and (5) squamous cell histology.

Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are widely used for statistical modeling, because of ease of inference and the ubiquitous use of the normal distribution in practical approximations. However, they are also known for their limited modeling abilities, due to the Gaussian assumption. In this paper, we introduce a novel variant of GGMs, which relaxes the Gaussian restriction and yet admits efficient inference. Specifically, we impose a bipartite structure on the GGM and govern the hidden variables by truncated normal distributions. The nonlinearity of the model is revealed by its connection to rectified linear unit (ReLU) neural networks. Meanwhile, thanks to the bipartite structure and appealing properties of truncated normals, we are able to train the models efficiently using contrastive divergence. We consider three output constructs, accounting for real-valued, binary and count data. We further extend the model to deep constructions and show that deep models can be used for unsupervised pre-training of rectifier neural networks.

The dichotomy between rhythmic local field and stochastic spike trains presents a challenge to the theory of brain rhythms in the framework of coupled oscillators. Previous studies have shown that when noise is large and recurrent inhibition is strong, a coherent network rhythm can be generated while single neurons fire intermittently at low rates compared to the frequency of the oscillation. However, these studies used too simplified synaptic kinetics to allow quantitative predictions of the population rhythmic frequency. Here we show how to derive quantitatively the coherent oscillation frequency for a randomly connected network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with realistic synaptic parameters. In a noise-dominated interneuronal network, the oscillation frequency depends much more on the shortest synaptic time constants (delay and rise time) than on the longer synaptic decay time, and approximately 200-Hz frequency can be realized with synaptic time constants taken from slice data. In a network composed of both interneurons and excitatory cells, the rhythmogenesis is a compromise between two scenarios: the fast purely interneuronal mechanism, and the slower feedback mechanism (relying on the excitatory-inhibitory loop). The properties of the rhythm are determined essentially by the ratio of time scales of excitatory and inhibitory currents and by the balance between the mean recurrent excitation and inhibition. Faster excitation than inhibition, or a higher excitation/inhibition ratio, favors the feedback loop and a much slower oscillation (typically in the gamma range).", "publication_location": "Journal of Neurophysiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.01095.2002", "citations": "530", "readership": "657", "tweets": "1", "news_mentions": " "},

Experimental protocols on humans present striking similarities with pair association task experiments in monkeys. Electrophysiological recordings of cortical neurons in such tasks have found two types of task-related activity, \"retrospective\" (related to a previously shown stimulus), and \"prospective\" (related to a stimulus that the monkey expects to appear, due to learned association between both stimuli). Mathematical models of cortical networks allow theorists to understand the link between the physiology of single neurons and synapses, and network behavior giving rise to retrospective and/or prospective activity. Here, we show that this type of network model can account for a large variety of priming effects.

PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three patients with LLD completed a 2-year follow-up study, and were in a remitted or partially remitted state at Year 2. METHODS: At first entry to the study (Year 0), all participants had a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while performing an emotional oddball task. For the purpose of this report, the primary functional magnetic resonance imaging outcome was brain activation during target detection, which is a measure of executive function. The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease neuropsychological battery was used to assess cognitive status yearly, and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale was used to assess severity of depression at Year 0 and every 6 months thereafter for 2 years. We investigated changes in brain activation at Year 0 associated with PCI over 2 years. RESULTS: Patients with PCI at the 2-year follow-up date had significantly decreased activation at Year 0 in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, inferior frontal cortex, and insula compared to non-PCI patients.

In this paper, the Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) based DPE has been presented and analyzed. Here, the PWM based signal, instead of the traditional amplitude modulated (AM) signal, is used as the computation variable. Comparing to the existing AM based system, this PWM counterpart provides an alternative approach to reduce the power consumption and chip area of its peripheral circuits. Power and area saving becomes more prominent when the size and/or the number of arrays increase. This new approach also provides the critically needed scalability to accommodate the computation variable with higher precision.

In such scenarios, defense technologies that require changing the training methods of the NCS, e.g., adversarial training become impracticable. In this work, we propose AdverQuil - an efficient adversarial detection and alleviation technique for black-box NCS.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, digital mammographic magnification views were collected for 99 subjects with DCIS at biopsy, 25 of which were subsequently upstaged to invasive cancer. A deep convolutional neural network model that was pretrained on nonmedical images (eg, animals, plants, instruments) was used as the feature extractor. Through a statistical pooling strategy, deep features were extracted at different levels of convolutional layers from the lesion areas, without sacrificing the original resolution or distorting the underlying topology. A multivariate classifier was then trained to predict which tumors contain occult invasive disease. This was compared with the performance of traditional \"handcrafted\" computer vision (CV) features previously developed specifically to assess mammographic calcifications. The generalization performance was assessed using Monte Carlo cross-validation and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Deep features were able to distinguish DCIS with occult invasion from pure DCIS, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.73).

Approximately 25% of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) diagnosed from core needle biopsy are subsequently upstaged to invasive cancer at surgical excision. Identifying patients with occult invasive disease is important as it changes treatment and precludes enrollment in active surveillance for DCIS. In this study, we investigated upstaging of DCIS to invasive disease using deep features. While deep neural networks require large amounts of training data, the available data to predict DCIS upstaging is sparse and thus directly training a neural network is unlikely to be successful. In this work, a pre-trained neural network is used as a feature extractor and a support vector machine (SVM) is trained on the extracted features. We used the dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRIs of patients at our institution from January 1, 2000, through March 23, 2014 who underwent MRI following a diagnosis of DCIS. Among the 131 DCIS patients, there were 35 patients who were upstaged to invasive cancer. Area under the ROC curve within the 10-fold cross-validation scheme was used for validation of our predictive model. The use of deep features was able to achieve an AUC of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.56-0.78) to predict occult invasive disease.

We propose to first randomly group arriving classes at each tree split node into two groups, obtaining a significantly simplified two-class classification problem that can be a handled with a light-weight CNN weak learner. Code uniqueness is achieved via the random class grouping, whilst code consistency is achieved using a low-rank loss in the CNN weak learners that encourages intra-class compactness for the two random class groups. Finally, we introduce an information-theoretic approach for aggregating codes of individual trees into a single hash code, producing a near-optimal unique hash for each class.

Recent advances in deep learning algorithms provide new opportunities for improving the design of BMI decoders, including the use of recurrent artificial neural networks to decode neuronal ensemble activity in real time. Here, we developed a long-short term memory (LSTM) decoder for extracting movement kinematics from the activity of large (N = 134-402) populations of neurons, sampled simultaneously from multiple cortical areas, in rhesus monkeys performing motor tasks. Recorded regions included primary motor, dorsal premotor, supplementary motor, and primary somatosensory cortical areas. The LSTM's capacity to retain information for extended periods of time enabled accurate decoding for tasks that required both movements and periods of immobility. Our LSTM algorithm significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art unscented Kalman filter when applied to three tasks: center-out arm reaching, bimanual reaching, and bipedal walking on a treadmill. Notably, LSTM units exhibited a variety of well-known physiological features of cortical neuronal activity, such as directional tuning and neuronal dynamics across task epochs. LSTM modeled several key physiological attributes of cortical circuits involved in motor tasks.

Consider observing a collection of discrete events within a network that reflect how network nodes influence one another. Such data are common in spike trains recorded from biological neural networks, interactions within a social network, and a variety of other settings. Data of this form may be modeled as self-exciting point processes, in which the likelihood of future events depends on the past events. This paper addresses the problem of estimating self-excitation parameters and inferring the underlying functional network structure from self-exciting point process data. Past work in this area was limited by strong assumptions which are addressed by the novel approach here. Specifically, in this paper we 1) incorporate saturation in a point process model which both ensures stability and models non-linear thresholding effects; 2) impose general low-dimensional structural assumptions that include sparsity, group sparsity, and low-rankness that allows bounds to be developed in the high-dimensional setting; and 3) incorporate long-range memory effects through moving average and higher-order auto-regressive components. Using our general framework, we provide a number of novel theoretical guarantees for high-dimensional self-exciting point processes that reflect the role played by the underlying network structure and long-term memory.

Network spiking activity evoked by sensory inputs consisting of face images altered synaptic efficacy, which resulted in the network responding more strongly to a previously seen face than a novel face. Network size determined how many faces could be accurately recognized as familiar. When the simulated model became sufficiently complex in structure, multiple familiarity traces could be retained in the same network by forming partially-overlapping subnetworks that differ slightly from each other, thereby resulting in a high storage capacity. Fisher's discriminant analysis was applied to identify critical neurons whose spiking activity predicted familiar input patterns. Intriguingly, as sensory exposure was prolonged, the selected critical neurons tended to appear at deeper layers of the network model, suggesting recruitment of additional circuits in the network for incremental information storage. We conclude that generic cortical microcircuits with bidirectional synaptic plasticity have an intrinsic ability to detect familiar inputs.

Subjects either matched the affect of one of two faces to that of a simultaneously presented target face (a perceptual task) or identified the affect of a target face by choosing one of two simultaneously presented linguistic labels (an intellectual task).

After this initial scan, MDD patients were treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and scanned again after treatment. Within regions that showed pre-treatment differences between patients and controls, we tested the association between pre-treatment activity and subsequent treatment response as well as activity changes from pre- to post-treatment. This study yielded three main findings. First, prior to treatment and relative to controls, patients exhibited overall reduced activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), diminished discrimination between emotional and neutral items in the amygdala, caudate, and hippocampus, and enhanced responses to negative versus positive stimuli in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and right dorsolateral PFC. Second, CBT-related symptom improvement in MDD patients was predicted by increased activity at baseline in ventromedial PFC as well as the valence effects in the ATL and dorsolateral PFC. Third, from pre- to post-treatment, MDD patients exhibited overall increases in ventromedial PFC activation, enhanced arousal responses in the amygdala, caudate, and hippocampus, and a reversal of valence effects in the ATL. The study was limited by the relatively small sample that was able to complete both scan sessions, as well as an inability to determine the influence of comorbid disorders within the current sample.

Remote sensing imagery is usually stored in the form of very large images, called \"tiles\", which are too big to be segmented directly using most CNNs and their associated hardware. Therefore smaller sub-images, called \"patches\", must be extracted from the available tiles. A popular strategy in the literature is to randomly sample patches from the tiles. However, in this work we demonstrate experimentally that extracting patches randomly from a uniform, non-overlapping spatial grid, leads to more accurate models. Our findings suggest the performance improvements are the result of reducing redundancy within the training dataset. We also find that sampling mini-batches of patches (for stochastic gradient descent) using constraints that maximizes the diversity of images within each batch leads to more accurate models.

Segmentation convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) are now popular for the semantic segmentation (i.e., dense pixel-wise labeling) of remote sensing imagery, such as color or hyperspectral satellite imagery. One desirable property of SCNNs when applied to remote sensing problems is rotational equivariance. This property implies that the class label assigned to a particular pixel (building, road, etc.) does not change if the input imagery is rotated by an arbitrary angle. We argue that recently proposed methods to make rotational equivariant SCNNs fall into two broad categories: easily employed methods that are somewhat ineffective, and highly effective methods that are complicated and potentially incompatible with state-of-the-art SCNN techniques. We propose a simple addition to the standard SCNN loss function that encourages the SCNN to be rotationally equivariant, and is easily added to modern SCNNs. We test the method on the Inria building labeling dataset and compare it to the popular simple approach of adding random rotational augmentations of the input imagery during training.

In particular, delayed pair-associate tasks have revealed neuronal correlates of long-term memory of associations between stimuli. Here, a recurrent cortical network model with Hebbian plastic synapses is subjected to the pair-associate protocol. In a first stage, learning leads to the appearance of delay activity, representing individual images ('retrospective' activity). As learning proceeds, the same learning mechanism uses retrospective delay activity together with choice stimulus activity to potentiate synapses connecting neural populations representing associated images. As a result, the neural population corresponding to the pair-associate of the image presented is activated prior to its visual stimulation ('prospective' activity). The probability of appearance of prospective activity is governed by the strength of the inter-population connections, which in turn depends on the frequency of pairings during training. The time course of the transitions from retrospective to prospective activity during the delay period is found to depend on the fraction of slow, N-methyl-d-aspartate-like receptors at excitatory synapses. For fast recurrent excitation, transitions are abrupt; slow recurrent excitation renders transitions gradual. Both scenarios lead to a gradual rise of delay activity when averaged over many trials, because of the stochastic nature of the transitions. The model reproduces most of the neuro-physiological data obtained during such tasks, makes experimentally testable predictions and demonstrates how persistent activity (working memory) brings about the learning of long-term associations.", "publication_location": "The European Journal of Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02908.x", "citations": "83", "readership": "117", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The neural network based method augments the decentralized local joint linear control of two SCARA type IBM 7540 robots and greatly improves systems performance for position-position control. In the position-position control strategy, the objective of the controller is to ensure that the end-effectors of both manipulators accurately track the pre-specified Cartesian space trajectories despite the effects of uncontrolled time-varying interaction forces exerted through a common load. A content addressable memory type strategy based on Albus' Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (albus, 1975) is used for the implementation of the neural controller. The neural network based controller is used to iteratively learn the characteristics of the system rather than having to prespecify an explicitly system model. The system is linearly controlled at the beginning of the iterative process, but as the task error decreases through iterations, the neural network controller takes over from the linear controller. The use of the linear controller in parallel with the neural controller ensures reasonable system performance during the early stages of neural controller learning. The net joint RMS positioners for the two robots decreases from 0.2 radian at the start of the iterations (mostly linear control) to 0.001 radian at the end of the iterations (mostly neural network control). The controllers themselves are composed of simple structures that are computationally efficient and suitable for real-time implementation with high sampling rates.

Simulated ensembles of neurons were used to compare how well the methods above could account for correlated neuronal firing. The simulations showed that 'population vectors' defined by PCA were broadly distributed over the neuronal ensembles; thus, PCA was unable to identify independent groupings of neurons that shared common sources of input. By contrast, the ICA methods were all able to identify groupings of neurons that emerged due to correlated firing. This result suggests that correlated neuronal firing is reflected in higher-order correlations between neurons and not simply in the neurons' covariance. To assess the significance of these methods for real neuronal ensembles, we analyzed data from populations of neurons recorded in the motor cortex of rats trained to perform a reaction-time task. Scores for PCA and ICA were reconstructed on a bin-by-bin basis for single trials. These data were then used to train an artificial neural network to discriminate between single trials with either short or long reaction-times. Classifications based on scores from the ICA-based methods were significantly better than those based on PCA. For example, scores for components defined with an ICA-based method, extended ICA (Lee et al., 1999), classified more trials correctly (80.58+/-1.25%) than PCA (73.14+/-0.84%) for an ensemble of 26 neurons recorded in the motor cortex (ANOVA: P < 0.005).

Cocaine users had greater activation in brain regions that tracked the favorability of gamble characteristics (i.e. increased activation to gains, but decreased activation to losses). In contrast, HIV infection was independently associated with lesser activation in regions that tracked the unfavorability of gamble characteristics.

We found that temporal lobe seizures associated with loss of consciousness produced CBF increases in the temporal lobe, followed by increases in bilateral midline subcortical structures. These changes were accompanied by marked bilateral CBF decreases in the frontal and parietal association cortex. In contrast, temporal lobe seizures in which consciousness was spared were not accompanied by these widespread CBF changes. The CBF decreases in frontal and parietal association cortex were strongly correlated with increases in midline structures such as the mediodorsal thalamus.

Recent computational studies have provided a mathematical description of such fast oscillations, using the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model. Here, we extend this theoretical framework to populations of more realistic Hodgkin-Huxley-type conductance-based neurons. In a noisy network of GABAergic neurons that are connected randomly and sparsely by chemical synapses, coherent oscillations emerge with a frequency that depends sensitively on the single cell's membrane dynamics. The population frequency can be predicted analytically from the synaptic time constants and the preferred phase of discharge during the oscillatory cycle of a single cell subjected to noisy sinusoidal input. The latter depends significantly on the single cell's membrane properties and can be understood in the context of the simplified exponential integrate-and-fire (EIF) neuron. We find that 200-Hz oscillations can be generated, provided the effective input conductance of single cells is large, so that the single neuron's phase shift is sufficiently small. In a two-population network of excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory neurons, recurrent excitation can either decrease or increase the population rhythmic frequency, depending on whether in a neuron the excitatory synaptic current follows or precedes the inhibitory synaptic current in an oscillatory cycle. Detailed single-cell properties have a substantial impact on population oscillations, even though rhythmicity does not originate from pacemaker neurons and is an emergent network phenomenon.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neurophysiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00510.2004", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

We consider flow dynamics in porous media as multi-layer networks in this work. More precisely, the solution (e.g., pressures and saturation) at the time instant n+1 depends on the solution at the time instant n and input parameters, such as permeability fields, forcing terms, and initial conditions. One can regard the solution as a multi-layer network, where each layer, in general, is a nonlinear forward map and the number of layers relates to the internal time steps. We will rely on rigorous model reduction concepts to define unknowns and connections between layers. It is critical to use reduced-order models for this purpose, which will identify the regions of influence and the appropriate number of variables.

We propose a new approach using quantitative spectral-domain (SD) OCT data to train a DL algorithm to quantify glaucomatous structural damage on optic disc photographs. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 32 820 pairs of optic disc photographs and SD OCT retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) scans from 2312 eyes of 1198 participants. METHODS: The sample was divided randomly into validation plus training (80%) and test (20%) sets, with randomization performed at the patient level. A DL convolutional neural network was trained to assess optic disc photographs and predict SD OCT average RNFL thickness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The DL algorithm performance was evaluated in the test sample by evaluating correlation and agreement between the predictions and actual SD OCT measurements. We also assessed the ability to discriminate eyes with glaucomatous visual field loss from healthy eyes with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The mean prediction of average RNFL thickness from all 6292 optic disc photographs in the test set was 83.3±14.5 μm, whereas the mean average RNFL thickness from all corresponding SD OCT scans was 82.5±16.8 μm (P = 0.164). There was a very strong correlation between predicted and observed RNFL thickness values (Pearson r = 0.832; R2 = 69.3%; P < 0.001), with mean absolute error of the predictions of 7.39 μm. The area under the ROC curves for discriminating glaucomatous from healthy eyes with the DL predictions and actual SD OCT average RNFL thickness measurements were 0.944 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.912-0.966) and 0.940 (95% CI, 0.902-0.966), respectively (P = 0.724). CONCLUSIONS: We introduced a novel DL approach to assess fundus photographs and provide quantitative information about the amount of neural damage that can be used to diagnose and stage glaucoma. In addition, training neural networks to predict SD OCT data objectively represents a new approach that overcomes limitations of human labeling and could be useful in other areas of ophthalmology.", "publication_location": "Ophthalmology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ophtha.2018.12.033", "citations": "25", "readership": "70", "tweets": "24", "news_mentions": " "},

In our simulations, the environment and the movements of the rat are chosen to mimic those commonly observed in neurophysiological experiments. The environment is represented as local views that depend on both the position and the heading direction of the rat. We hypothesize that place cells are intrinsically directional, that is, they respond to local views. We show that the synaptic dynamics in the recurrent neural network rapidly modify the discharge correlates of the place cells: Cells tend to become omnidirectional place cells in open fields, while their directionality tends to get stronger in radial-arm mazes. We also find that the synaptic learning mechanisms account for other properties of place cell activity, such as an increase in the place cell peak firing rates as well as clustering of place fields during exploration.

We use two versions of this model: (1) an unconnected network in which neurons are activated as independent Poisson processes; and (2) a network with an interaction matrix, estimated from the data, representing effective interactions between the neurons. The unconnected model (model 1) is sufficient to account for the statistics of repeating patterns in 11 of the 15 datasets studied. Model 2, with interactions between neurons, is required to account for pattern statistics of the remaining four. Three of these four datasets are the ones that contain the largest number of transitions, suggesting that long datasets are in general necessary to render interactions statistically visible. We then study the topology of the matrix of interactions estimated for these four datasets. For three of the four datasets, we find sparse matrices with long-tailed degree distributions and an overrepresentation of certain network motifs.

This network is able to store in a short-term memory an angular variable (the head direction) as a spatial profile of activity across neurons in the absence of selective external inputs, and to accurately update this variable on the basis of angular velocity inputs. The network is composed of one excitatory population and two inhibitory populations, with inter-connections between populations but no connections within the neurons of a same population. In particular, there are no excitatory-to-excitatory connections. Angular velocity signals are represented as inputs in one inhibitory population (clockwise turns) or the other (counterclockwise turns). The system is studied using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Analysis of a simplified model composed of threshold-linear neurons gives the conditions on the connectivity for (i) the emergence of the spatially selective profile, (ii) reliable integration of angular velocity inputs, and (iii) the range of angular velocities that can be accurately integrated by the model. Numerical simulations allow us to study the proposed scenario in a large network of spiking neurons and compare their dynamics with that of head direction cells recorded in the rat limbic system.

Consistent with behavioral findings, we identified common activity in the right amygdala, but age-related differences in the functional connectivity of this region with the rest of the brain. Compared to young adults, older adults had greater functional connectivity between the right amygdala and ventral anterior cingulate cortex, possibly reflecting increased emotional regulation.

With the rise of artificial intelligence in recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been widely used in many domains. To achieve high performance and energy efficiency, hardware acceleration (especially inference) of DNNs is intensively studied both in academia and industry. However, we still face two challenges: Large DNN models and datasets, which incur frequent off-chip memory accesses; and the training of DNNs, which is not well-explored in recent accelerator designs. To truly provide high throughput and energy efficient acceleration for the training of deep and large models, we inevitably need to use multiple accelerators to explore the coarse-grain parallelism, compared to the fine-grain parallelism inside a layer considered in most of the existing architectures. It poses the key research question to seek the best organization of computation and dataflow among accelerators. In this paper, we propose a solution HYPAR to determine layer-wise parallelism for deep neural network training with an array of DNN accelerators. HYPAR partitions the feature map tensors (input and output), the kernel tensors, the gradient tensors, and the error tensors for the DNN accelerators. A partition constitutes the choice of parallelism for weighted layers. The optimization target is to search a partition that minimizes the total communication during training a complete DNN. To solve this problem, we propose a communication model to explain the source and amount of communications. Then, we use a hierarchical layer-wise dynamic programming method to search for the partition for each layer. HYPAR is practical: The time complexity for the partition search in HYPAR is linear. We apply this method in an HMC-based DNN training architecture to minimize data movement. We evaluate HYPAR with ten DNN models from classic Lenet to large-size model VGGs, and the number of weighted layers of these models range from four to nineteen. Our evaluation finds that: The default Model Parallelism is indeed the worst; the default Data Parallelism is not the best; but hybrid parallelism can be better than either the default Data Parallelism or Model Parallelism in DNN training with an array of accelerators. Our evaluation shows that HYPAR achieves a performance gain of 3.39× and an energy efficiency gain of 1.51× compared to Data Parallelism on average, and HYPAR performs up to 2.40× better than \"one weird trick\".", "publication_location": "Proceedings   25th Ieee International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture, Hpca 2019", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HPCA.2019.00027", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Currently, between 66% and 90% of biopsies are performed on benign lesions. Our system is designed to help decrease the number of benign biopsies without missing malignancies. Clinicians interpret the mammograms using a standard reporting lexicon. The case-based reasoning system compares these findings with a database of cases with known outcomes (from biopsy) and returns the fraction of similar cases that were malignant. This malignancy fraction is an intuitive response that the clinician can then consider when making the decision regarding biopsy. RESULTS: The system was evaluated using a round-robin sampling scheme and performed with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83, comparable with the performance of a neural network model. If only the cases returning a malignancy fraction of greater than a threshold of 0.10 are sent to biopsy, no malignancies would be missed, and the number of benign biopsies would be decreased by 25%.

RESULTS: The BP-ANN performed significantly better on masses than microcalcifications in terms of both the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the partial receiver operating characteristic area index. A similar difference in performance was observed with a second model (linear discriminant analysis) and also with a second data set from a similar institution. CONCLUSION: Masses and calcifications should be considered separately when evaluating CAD systems for breast cancer diagnosis.", "publication_location": "Radiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2232011257", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The artificial neural network model underwent three trials: it was optimized over 500 biopsy-proven lesions from Duke University Medical Center or \"Duke,\" evaluated on 1,000 similar cases from the University of Pennsylvania Health System or \"Penn,\" and reoptimized for Penn. RESULTS: Trial A's Duke-only model yielded 98% sensitivity, 36% specificity, area index (A(z)) of 0.86, and partial A(z) of 0.51. The cross-institutional trial B yielded 96% sensitivity, 28% specificity, A(z) of 0.79, and partial A(z) of 0.28. The decreases were significant for both A(z) (p = 0.017) and partial A(z) (p < 0.001). In trial C, the model reoptimized for the Penn data yielded 96% sensitivity, 35% specificity, A(z) of 0.83, and partial A(z) of 0.32. There were no significant differences compared with trial B for specificity (p = 0.44) or partial A(z) (p = 0.46), suggesting that the Penn data were inherently more difficult to characterize. CONCLUSION: The BI-RADS lexicon facilitated the cross-institutional test of a breast cancer prediction model. The model generalized reasonably well, but there were significant performance decreases. The cross-institutional performance was encouraging because it was not significantly different from that of a reoptimized model using the second data set at high sensitivities.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study. A waiver of informed consent was obtained. Mammographic and sonographic examinations were performed in 737 patients (age range, 17-87 years), which yielded 803 breast mass lesions (296 malignant, 507 benign). Radiologist-interpreted features from mammograms and sonograms were used as input features for linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and artificial neural network (ANN) models to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. An LDA with all the features was compared with an LDA with only stepwise-selected features. Classification performances were quantified by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and were evaluated in a train, validate, and retest scheme. On the retest set, both LDAs were compared with radiologist assessment score of malignancy. RESULTS: Both the LDA and ANN achieved high classification performance with cross validation (area under the ROC curve [A(z)] = 0.92 +/- 0.01 [standard deviation] and (0.90)A(z) = 0.54 +/- 0.08 for LDA, A(z) = 0.92 +/- 0.01 and (0.90)A(z) = 0.55 +/- 0.08 for ANN).

Input nodes included data from clinical history, physical examination, laboratory investigation, and radiographic study. The ANN was trained and tested on data from all 140 cases by using a round-robin method and was compared with linear discriminate analysis. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to evaluate both predictive models. RESULTS: CT examinations in 50 cases were positive for abscess. This finding was confirmed by means of laboratory culture of aspirations from CT-guided percutaneous drainage in 38 patients, ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage in five patients, surgery in five patients, and characteristic appearance on CT scans without aspiration in two patients. CT scans in 90 cases were negative for abscess. The sensitivity and specificity of the ANN in predicting the presence of intraabdominal abscess were 90% and 51%, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed no statistically significant difference in performance between the two predictive models.

OBJECTIVES: The work presented here represents an effort to expand and test the capabilities of the MChip to differentiate influenza A/H1N1 of various species origin. METHODS: The MChip ANN was trained to recognize fluorescence image patterns of a variety of known influenza A viruses, including examples of human H1N1, human H3N2, swine H1N1, 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1, and a wide variety of avian, equine, canine, and swine influenza viruses. Robustness of the MChip ANN was evaluated using 296 blinded isolates. RESULTS: Training of the ANN was expanded by the addition of 71 well-characterized influenza A isolates and yielded relatively high accuracy (little misclassification) in distinguishing unique H1N1 strains: nine human A/H1N1 (88·9% correct), 35 human A/H3N2 (97·1% correct), 31 North American swine A/H1N1 (80·6% correct), 14 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 (87·7% correct), and 23 negative samples (91·3% correct). Genetic diversity among the swine H1N1 isolates may have contributed to the lower success rate for these viruses.

Artificial neural network (ANN) as a modeling tool has demonstrated its ability to assimilate information from multiple sources and to detect subtle and complex patterns. In this paper, an ANN model was evaluated for its performance in detecting early stage epithelial ovarian cancer using multiple serum markers. METHODS: Serum specimens collected at four institutions in the US, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were analyzed for CA 125II, CA 72-4, CA 15-3 and macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). The four tumor marker values were then used as inputs to an ANN derived using a training set from 100 apparently healthy women, 45 women with benign conditions arising from the ovary and 55 invasive epithelial ovarian cancer patients (including 27 stage I/II cases). A separate validation set from 27 apparently healthy women, 56 women with benign conditions and 35 women with various types of malignant pelvic masses was used to monitor the ANN's performance during training. An independent test data set from 98 apparently healthy women and 52 early stage epithelial ovarian cancer patients (38 stage I and 4 stage II invasive cases and 10 stage I borderline ovarian tumor cases) was used to evaluate the ANN. RESULTS: ROC analysis confirmed the overall superiority of the ANN-derived composite index over CA 125II alone (p=0.0333). At a fixed specificity of 98%, the sensitivities for ANN and CA 125II alone were 71% (37/52) and 46% (24/52) (p=0.047), respectively, for detecting early stage epithelial ovarian cancer, and 71% (30/42) and 43% (18/42) (p=0.040), respectively, for detecting invasive early stage epithelial ovarian cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of multiple tumor markers through an ANN improves the overall accuracy to discern healthy women from patients with early stage ovarian cancer.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are tremendously applied in artificial intelligence field. While the performance of DNNs is continuously improved by more complicated and deeper structures, the feasibility of deployment on embedded system remains as a critical problem. Neuromorphic system designs based on resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) provide an opportunity for power-efficient DNN employment. However, it encounters the challenge of limited programming resolution. A quantized training method is proposed in this paper to enhance the performance of neuromorphic systems based on ReRAM. Different from previous methods in which a dedicated regularization term is used in loss function to constrain parameter distribution, our quantized training method deals with training and quantization at the same time to alleviate the impact of limited parameter precision. Models with discrete parameters obtained after training can be directly mapped onto ReRAM devices. We implement experiments on image recognition tasks using multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolution neural network (CNN). The results verify that the quantized training method can approximate the accuracy of full-precision training, e.g., a two-layer MLP based on binary ReRAM only decreases the classification accuracy by 0.25% for MNIST dataset. In addition, we carefully investigate and present the importance of layer size under the ReRAM's low programming resolution, the different parameter resolution demands for convolution layer and fully connected layer, and system robustness to ReRAM variations after quantized training.

Our group has performed a number of recent studies that help to answer a number of important clinical questions. First, do we need to order computed tomography of the chest (CCT) to stage all newly diagnosed patients? Second, how accurate is contemporary era abdominal CT to stage the retroperitoneum in low-stage nonseminoma patients, and are there techniques that may improve accuracy? Third, can histological primary tumor factors be useful to predict stage in low-stage nonseminoma patients? In a study of 201 testicular cancer patients [117 (58%) NSGCT, 84 (42%) seminoma] who had both CCT and chest X-ray (CXR) in initial staging, CXR alone was found to be sufficient initial chest staging in all seminoma patients and in NSGCT patients who had a negative abdominal (CTA). For low-stage patients without retroperitoneal adenopathy, CCT had unacceptable false-positive rates, which precipitated additional invasive maneuvers. For higher stage NSGCT patients with retroperitoneal disease on initial CTA, CXR alone missed a significant number of occult thoracic metastases and CCT remains indicated. In a study of 57 clinical stage 1 NSGCT all having negative staging CTA followed by surgical staging, third and fourth generation CT had a 67% accuracy in predicting retroperitoneal metastases. This contemporary experience shows a 33% false-negative abdominal CT staging rate. Consideration of any nodes, regardless of size, in the primary echelon retroperitoneal areas as indicative of retroperitoneal metastases may hold promise for improving accuracy of CTA in low-stage NSGCT testis cancer. In a study of 92 clinical stage 1 NSGCT patients, determination of primary tumor vascular invasion (VI) and percentage of tumor composed of embryonal carcinoma component (%EMB) was found to be a useful staging tool. A multivariate model using VI and %EMB was able to predict correct stage in 86% of the study cohort, and a probability table with these two variables was created. Using these histological variables in a neural network artificial intelligence program, an expert correctly predicted stage in 92% of patients. In the 1990s chest staging should be tailored to tumor cell type and retroperitoneal disease status. Staging of the retroperitoneum utilizing abdominal CT remains problematic due to the inability to detect microscopic metastases.

This is an Open Access article under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license Background: Radical measures are required to identify and reduce blindness due to diabetes to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) model using deep learning in a population-based diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Zambia, a lower-middle-income country. Methods: We adopted an ensemble AI model consisting of a combination of two convolutional neural networks (an adapted VGGNet architecture and a residual neural network architecture) for classifying retinal colour fundus images. We trained our model on 76 370 retinal fundus images from 13 099 patients with diabetes who had participated in the Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Program, between 2010 and 2013, which has been published previously. In this clinical validation study, we included all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes that attended a mobile screening unit in five urban centres in the Copperbelt province of Zambia from Feb 1 to June 31, 2012. In our model, referable diabetic retinopathy was defined as moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse, diabetic macular oedema, and ungradable images. Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy comprised severe non-proliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for referable diabetic retinopathy, and sensitivities of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema compared with the grading by retinal specialists. We did a multivariate analysis for systemic risk factors and referable diabetic retinopathy between AI and human graders. Findings: A total of 4504 retinal fundus images from 3093 eyes of 1574 Zambians with diabetes were prospectively recruited. Referable diabetic retinopathy was found in 697 (22·5%) eyes, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy in 171 (5·5%) eyes, and diabetic macular oedema in 249 (8·1%) eyes. The AUC of the AI system for referable diabetic retinopathy was 0·973 (95% CI 0·969–0·978), with corresponding sensitivity of 92·25% (90·10–94·12) and specificity of 89·04% (87·85–90·28). Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy sensitivity was 99·42% (99·15–99·68) and diabetic macular oedema sensitivity was 97·19% (96·61–97·77). The AI model and human graders showed similar outcomes in referable diabetic retinopathy prevalence detection and systemic risk factors associations. Both the AI model and human graders identified longer duration of diabetes, higher level of glycated haemoglobin, and increased systolic blood pressure as risk factors associated with referable diabetic retinopathy. Interpretation: An AI system shows clinically acceptable performance in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular oedema in population-based diabetic retinopathy screening. This shows the potential application and adoption of such AI technology in an under-resourced African population to reduce the incidence of preventable blindness, even when the model is trained in a different population.

In this work, we propose a system to automatically learn features for grading the severity of nuclear cataracts from slit-lamp images. Local filters learned from image patches are fed into a convolutional neural network, followed by a set of recursive neural networks to further extract higher-order features. With these features, support vector regression is applied to determine the cataract grade.

The effective implementation of treatment technologies requires knowledge of mercury speciation in the flue gas, namely concentrations of elemental, oxidized and particulate mercury at the exit of the boiler. A model that can accurately predict mercury species in flue gas would be very useful in that context. Here, a Bayesian regularized artificial neural network (BRANN) that uses five coal properties and combustion temperature was developed to predict mercury speciation in flue gases before treatment technology implementation. The results of the model show that up to 97 percent of the variation in mercury species concentration is captured through the use of BRANNs. The BRANN model was used to conduct a parametric sensitivity which revealed that the coal chlorine content and coal calorific value were the most sensitive parameters, followed by the combustion temperature. The coal sulfur content was the least important parameter. The results demonstrate the applicability of BRANNs for predicting mercury concentration and speciation in combustion flue gas and provide a more efficient and effective technique when compared to other advanced non-mechanistic modeling strategies.", "publication_location": "Journal of Hazardous Materials", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2013.10.052", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Chronic high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is effective in suppressing parkinsonian motor symptoms and modulates cortical activity. However, the anatomical pathways responsible for STN DBS-mediated cortical modulation remain unclear. Cortical evoked potentials (cEP) generated by STN DBS reflect the response of cortex to subcortical stimulation, and the goal of this study was to determine the neural origin of STN DBS-generated cEP using a two-step approach. First, we recorded cEP over ipsilateral primary motor cortex during different frequencies of STN DBS in awake healthy and unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned parkinsonian rats. Second, we used a detailed, biophysically based model of the thalamocortical network to deconstruct the neural origin of the recorded cEP. The in vivo cEP included short (R1)-, intermediate (R2)-, and long-latency (R3) responses. Model-based cortical responses to simulated STN DBS matched remarkably well the in vivo responses. The short-latency response was generated by antidromic activation of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, whereas recurrent activation of layer 5 pyramidal neurons via excitatory axon collaterals reproduced the intermediate-latency response. The long-latency response was generated by polysynaptic activation of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons via the cortico-thalamic-cortical pathway. Antidromic activation of the hyperdirect pathway and subsequent intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical synaptic interactions were sufficient to generate cortical potential evoked by STN DBS, and orthodromic activation through basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex pathways was not required. These results demonstrate the utility of cEP to determine the neural elements activated by STN DBS that might modulate cortical activity and contribute to the suppression of parkinsonian symptoms. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is increasingly used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). Cortical potentials evoked by STN DBS in patients with PD exhibit consistent short-latency (1-3 ms), intermediate-latency (5-15 ms), and long-latency (18-25 ms) responses. The short-latency response occurs as a result of antidromic activation of the hyperdirect pathway comprising corticosubthalamic axons. However, the neural origins of intermediate- and long-latency responses remain elusive, and the dominant view is that these are produced through the orthodromic pathway (basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex). By combining in vivo electrophysiology with computational modeling, we demonstrate that antidromic activation of the cortico-thalamic-cortical pathway is sufficient to generate the intermediate- and long-latency cortical responses to STN DBS.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neurophysiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00862.2017", "citations": "9", "readership": "35", "tweets": "7", "news_mentions": " "},

However, investigation is lacking on the dynamic interactive effect of those biases during decision making. Employing a card-guessing game that independently manipulates trial-by-trial perceived control and gamble outcome among 29 healthy female participants, we observed both IoC- and GF-type behaviors, as well as an interactive effect of previous control and previous outcome, with GF-type behaviors only following computer-selected, but not self-selected, outcomes. Imaging results implicated the ACC and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in agency processing, and the cerebellum and right DLPFC in previous outcome processing, in accordance with past literature. Critically, the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) exhibited significant betting-related activities to the interaction of previous control and previous outcome, showing more positive signals to previous computer-selected winning versus losing outcomes but the reverse pattern following self-selected outcomes, as well as responding to the interactive effect of control and outcome during feedback. Associations were also found between participants' behavioral sensitivity to the interactive effect of previous control and previous outcome, and right IPL signals, as well as its functional connectivity with neural networks implicated in agency and previous outcome processing.

However, progress was made by recent neurophysiological experiments reporting that EEG delta-band phase and gamma-band amplitude reliably predict some complementary aspects of the time course of spikes of visual cortical neurons. To elucidate the mechanisms behind these findings, here we hypothesize that the EEG delta phase reflects shifts of local cortical excitability arising from slow fluctuations in the network input due to entrainment to sensory stimuli or to fluctuations in ongoing activity, and that the resulting local excitability fluctuations modulate both the spike rate and the engagement of excitatory-inhibitory loops producing gamma-band oscillations. We quantitatively tested these hypotheses by simulating a recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons stimulated with dynamic inputs presenting temporal regularities similar to that of thalamic responses during naturalistic visual stimulation and during spontaneous activity. The network model reproduced in detail the experimental relationships between spike rate and EEGs, and suggested that the complementariness of the prediction of spike rates obtained from EEG delta phase or gamma amplitude arises from nonlinearities in the engagement of excitatory-inhibitory loops and from temporal modulations in the amplitude of the network input, which respectively limit the predictability of spike rates from gamma amplitude or delta phase alone. The model suggested also ways to improve and extend current algorithms for online prediction of spike rates from EEGs.", "publication_location": "Neuroimage", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.12.040", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Segmentation convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are now popular for the semantic segmentation (i.e., dense pixel-wise labeling) of remote sensing imagery, such as color or hyperspectral satellite imagery. In recent years a large number of hand-labeled datasets of overhead imagery have emerged, leading to breakthrough performance for CNNs. However, these datasets are typically used in isolation of one another because they are either (i) annotated with heterogeneous object type labels, or (ii) they are collected over different geographic areas. This imposes a major bottleneck on the value of these datasets. In this work we present what we call a class-asymmetric loss function that makes it possible to train a single multi-class network using multiple datasets that are heterogeneously-labeled. We show, for example, that it is possible to train a segmentation algorithm for Buildings, roads, and background using two datasets: one annotated with buildings and one annotated with buildings.

Activity in the amygdala predicted enhanced emotional memory, with subsequent-memory activity greater for negative stimuli than for neutral stimuli, across age groups, a finding consistent with an overall enhancement of emotional memory. However, older adults recruited greater activity in anterior regions and less activity in posterior regions in general for negative stimuli that were subsequently remembered. Functional connectivity of the amygdala with the rest of the brain was consistent with age-related reductions in memory for negative stimuli: Older adults showed decreased functional connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus, but increased functional connectivity between the amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices.

The present study targeted regions within core brain networks - default mode network, salience network, executive control network, and emotion network - reported altered in AMS and ATD, and used regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) analyses to explore their overlapped effects. We additionally examined the relationships among core neural networks - operationalized as an index of resource allocation bias that quantifies the shift from internal to external modes of processing. We found both manipulations induced increased ReHo of the amygdala and decreased ReHo of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The PCC-amygdala FC was negatively correlated with the change of negative affect, whereas the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula FC was positively associated with anxiety level. In addition, we found that a greater shift to an external mode was correlated with higher anxiety level under both conditions.

Guided by the bound, we propose layer-wise ternarizing and gradient clipping to improve its convergence. Our experiments show that applying TernGrad on AlexNet doesn't incur any accuracy loss and can even improve accuracy. The accuracy loss of GoogLeNet induced by TernGrad is less than 2% on average.

In such applications of SG-MCMC, it is becoming increasingly popular to employ distributed systems, where stochastic gradients are computed based on some outdated parameters, yielding what are termed stale gradients. While stale gradients could be directly used in SG-MCMC, their impact on convergence properties has not been well studied. In this paper we develop theory to show that while the bias and MSE of an SG-MCMC algorithm depend on the staleness of stochastic gradients, its estimation variance (relative to the expected estimate, based on a prescribed number of samples) is independent of it. In a simple Bayesian distributed system with SG-MCMC, where stale gradients are computed asynchronously by a set of workers, our theory indicates a linear speedup on the decrease of estimation variance w.r.t. the number of workers.

The networks describe how agents learn to predict future events by 1) building models of the world, 2) inferring new predictions from past experiences, 3) combining elementary environmental stimuli into complex internal representations, 4) attending to stimuli associated with environmental novelty, and 5) attending to stimuli that are good predictors of other environmental events. When a predictive network is attached to a goal-seeking system, the resulting architecture is able to describe spatial and maze navigation, as well as problem solving and planning. When the predictions of future events are based on the combination of environmental stimuli and the animal's own responses, the networks provide the information necessary to choose between alternative behaviors. When the agent's own responses can be identified with the responses of other agents, the networks can describe learning by imitation. Whereas some of the agent's responses produce substantial modifications of the environment, others simply constitute signals used to communicate with other agents. In addition to affecting the behavior of other agents, these signals have an effect in the emitting animal itself. It is suggested that these principles might be applied to the design of adaptive, communicating autonomous robots. © 1996 IEEE.", "publication_location": "Proceedings of the Ieee", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/5.537118", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

However, early theories are inconsistent with the conclusions of psychophysical experiments manipulating external noise, whereas late theories cannot explain the changes in neural responses that have been reported in cortical areas V1 and V4.

Deconvolution has been widespread in neural networks.

Resistive RAM (ReRAM)-based processing-in-memory architecture has been widely explored in accelerating convolutional computation and demonstrates good performance. Performing deconvolution on existing ReRAM-based accelerator designs, however, suffers from long latency and high energy consumption because deconvolutional computation includes not only convolution but also extra add-on operations. To realize the more efficient execution for deconvolution, we analyze its computation requirement and propose a ReRAM-based accelerator design, namely, RED. More specific, RED integrates two orthogonal methods, the pixel-wise mapping scheme for reducing redundancy caused by zero-inserting operations and the zero-skipping data flow for increasing the computation parallelism and therefore improving performance.

Stochastic dynamics of classical degrees of freedom, defined on vertices of locally tree-like graphs, can be studied in the framework of the dynamic cavity method which is exact for tree graphs. Such models correspond for example to spin-glass systems, Boolean networks, neural networks, and other technical, biological, and social networks. The central objects in the cavity method are edge messages - conditional probabilities of two vertex variable trajectories. In this paper, we discuss a rather pedagogical derivation for the dynamic cavity method, give a detailed account of the novel matrix product edge message (MPEM) algorithm for the solution of the dynamic cavity equation as introduced in Barthel et al (2018 Phys.

Computation costs and precision can be tuned by controlling the matrix dimensions of the MPEM in truncations. Without truncations, the dynamics is exact. Data for Glauber-Ising dynamics shows a linear growth of computation costs in time. In contrast to Monte Carlo simulations, the approach has a much better error scaling.

For the simpler evolutionary model lacking recombination, we analyze the system as a neutral network. This allows us to describe the equilibrium distribution networks within genotype space. Our results show that, given a sufficiently large population size, the qualitative observation that systems evolve to be robust, is itself robust, as it does not depend on the details of the model.

Deep neural networks trained using a softmax layer at the top and the cross-entropy loss are ubiquitous tools for image classification. Yet, this does not naturally enforce intra-class similarity nor inter-class margin of the learned deep representations. To simultaneously achieve these two goals, different solutions have been proposed in the literature, such as the pairwise or triplet losses. However, these carry the extra task of selecting pairs or triplets, and the extra computational burden of computing and learning for many combinations of them. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play loss term for deep networks that explicitly reduces intra-class variance and enforces inter-class margin simultaneously, in a simple and elegant geometric manner. For each class, the deep features are collapsed into a learned linear subspace, or union of them, and inter-class subspaces are pushed to be as orthogonal as possible. Our proposed Orthogonal Low-rank Embedding (OLÃ‰) does not require carefully crafting pairs or triplets of samples for training, and works standalone as a classification loss, being the first reported deep metric learning framework of its kind. Because of the improved margin between features of different classes, the resulting deep networks generalize better, are more discriminative, and more robust. We demonstrate improved classification performance in general object recognition, plugging the proposed loss term into existing off-the-shelf architectures. In particular, we show the advantage of the proposed loss in the small data/model scenario, and we significantly advance the state-of-the-art on the Stanford STL-10 benchmark.", "publication_location": "Proceedings of the Ieee Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2018.00846", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

This research examined multiple cognitive workload measures, including secondary task performance and physiological (cardiac) measures, as inputs to a neural network for operator functional state classification during a simulated air traffic control (ATC) task. Twenty-five participants performed a low-fidelity simulation under manual control or 1 of 4 different forms of automation. Traffic volume was either low (3 aircraft) or high (7 aircraft). Participants also performed a secondary (gauge) monitoring task. Results demonstrated significant effects of traffic volume (workload) on aircraft clearances (p < .01) and trajectory conflicts (p < .01), secondary task performance (p < .01), and subjective ratings of task workload (p < .01). The form of ATC automation affected the number of aircraft collisions (p < .05), secondary task performance (p < .01), and heart rate (HR; p < .01). However, heart rate and heart rate variability measures were not sensitive to the traffic manipulation. Neural network models of controller workload (defined in terms of traffic volume) were developed using the secondary task performance and simple heart rate measure as inputs. The best workload classification accuracy using a genetic algorithm (across all forms of ATC automation) was 64%, comparable to prior work. Additional neural network models of workload for each mode of ATC automation revealed substantial variability in predictive accuracy, based on the characteristics of the automation. Secondary task performance was a highly sensitive indicator of ATC workload, whereas the heart rate measure appeared to operate as a more global indicator of workload. A limited range of cardiac response might be sufficient for the demands of the brain in ATC. The results have applicability to design of future adaptive systems integrating neural-network-based workload state classifiers for multiple forms of automation.

Video prediction into sufficiently long future has many potential applications. Modeling long-term dynamics for times series is challenging with convolution neural network structure, which is usually good for capturing short-term dependencies. In this work, we propose to embed the convolutional neural network within a spatial-temporal pyramid structure, to exploit both long-term and short-term temporal dependency and capture both macro-scale and micro-scale spatial structures. The prediction at a given scale is conditioned on the features extracted from a lower scale and past observations from the current scale. In order to overcome the blurry issue caused by the mean square error loss, we add a critic model with Wasserstein distance based adversarial loss to complement MSE.

A sparsity-regularized maximum likelihood estimator is proposed for a Poisson autoregressive process.

Vector autoregressive models characterize a variety of time series in which linear combinations of current and past observations can be used to accurately predict future observations. For instance, each element of an observation vector could correspond to a different node in a network, and the parameters of an autoregressive model would correspond to the impact of the network structure on the time series evolution. Often, these models are used successfully in practice to learn the structure of social, epidemiological, financial, or biological neural networks. However, little is known about statistical guarantees on the estimates of such models in non-Gaussian settings. This paper addresses the inference of the autoregressive parameters and associated network structure within a generalized linear model framework that includes Poisson and Bernoulli autoregressive processes. At the heart of this analysis is a sparsity-regularized maximum likelihood estimator. While sparsity-regularization is well-studied in the statistics and machine learning communities, those analysis methods cannot be applied to autoregressive generalized linear models because of the correlations and potential heteroscedasticity inherent in the observations.

First, we study the stability of spontaneous activity in an unstructured network. It is shown that the stochastic background activity, of 1-5 spikes/s, is unstable if all neurons are excitatory. On the other hand, spontaneous activity becomes self-stabilizing in presence of local inhibition, given reasonable values of the parameters of the network. Second, in a network sustaining physiological spontaneous rates, we study the effect of learning in a local module, expressed in synaptic modifications in specific populations of synapses. We find that if the average synaptic potentiation (LTP) is too low, no stimulus specific activity manifests itself in the delay period. Instead, following the presentation and removal of any stimulus there is, in the local module, a delay activity in which all neurons selective (responding visually) to any of the stimuli presented for learning have rates which gradually increase with the amplitude of synaptic potentiation. When the average LTP increases beyond a critical value, specific local attractors (stable states) appear abruptly against the background of the global uniform spontaneous attractor. In this case the local module has two available types of collective delay activity: if the stimulus is unfamiliar, the activity is spontaneous; if it is similar to a learned stimulus, delay activity is selective. These new attractors reflect the synaptic structure developed during learning. In each of them a small population of neurons have elevated rates, which depend on the strength of LTP. The remaining neurons of the module have their activity at spontaneous rates.

We consider the analysis of Electroencephalography (EEG) and Local Field Potential (LFP) datasets, which are \"big\" in terms of the size of recorded data but rarely have sufficient labels required to train complex models (e.g., conventional deep learning methods). Furthermore, in many scientific applications, the goal is to be able to understand the underlying features related to the classification, which prohibits the blind application of deep networks. This motivates the development of a new model based on parameterized convolutional filters guided by previous neuroscience research; the filters learn relevant frequency bands while targeting synchrony, which are frequency-specific power and phase correlations between electrodes. This results in a highly expressive convolutional neural network with only a few hundred parameters, applicable to smaller datasets. The proposed approach is demonstrated to yield competitive (often state-of-the-art) predictive performance during our empirical tests while yielding interpretable features.

To understand the mechanisms of the MW dependence of K(AV), we investigated K(AV) in tissue phantoms composed of tumor cells in 1% agarose gels, and performed numerical simulations of the available volume fraction in pore networks.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved single-center study, we analyzed DCE-MR images of 270 patients at our institution. Lesions of interest were identified by radiologists. The task was to automatically determine whether the tumor is of the Luminal A subtype or of another subtype based on the MR image patches representing the tumor. Three different deep learning approaches were used to classify the tumor according to their molecular subtypes: learning from scratch where only tumor patches were used for training, transfer learning where networks pre-trained on natural images were fine-tuned using tumor patches, and off-the-shelf deep features where the features extracted by neural networks trained on natural images were used for classification with a support vector machine. Network architectures utilized in our experiments were GoogleNet, VGG, and CIFAR. We used 10-fold crossvalidation method for validation and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) as the measure of performance. RESULTS: The best AUC performance for distinguishing molecular subtypes was 0.65 (95% CI:[0.57,0.71]) and was achieved by the off-the-shelf deep features approach. The highest AUC performance for training from scratch was 0.58 (95% CI:[0.51,0.64]) and the best AUC performance for transfer learning was 0.60 (95% CI:[0.52,0.65]) respectively.

The neural retina comprises a mosaic of rod and cone photoreceptors. Cone and rod photoreceptors degenerate upon rod-specific expression of heterogeneous mutations in functionally distinct genes, whereas cone-specific mutations are thought to cause only cone demise. Here we show that conditional ablation in cone photoreceptors of Ran-binding protein-2 (Ranbp2), a cell context-dependent pleiotropic protein linked to neuroprotection, familial necrotic encephalopathies, acute transverse myelitis and tumor-suppression, promotes early electrophysiological deficits, subcellular erosive destruction and non-apoptotic death of cones, whereas rod photoreceptors undergo cone-dependent non-autonomous apoptosis. Cone-specific Ranbp2 ablation causes the temporal activation of a cone-intrinsic molecular cascade highlighted by the early activation of metalloproteinase 11/stromelysin-3 and up-regulation of Crx and CoREST, followed by the down-modulation of cone-specific phototransduction genes, transient up-regulation of regulatory/survival genes and activation of caspase-7 without apoptosis. Conversely, PARP1+ -apoptotic rods develop upon sequential activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and loss of membrane permeability. Rod photoreceptor demise ceases upon cone degeneration. These findings reveal novel roles of Ranbp2 in the modulation of intrinsic and extrinsic cell death mechanisms and pathways. They also unveil a novel spatiotemporal paradigm of progression of neurodegeneration upon cell-specific genetic damage whereby a cone to rod non-autonomous death pathway with intrinsically distinct cell-type death manifestations is triggered by cell-specific loss of Ranbp2.

Ensembles of up to 23 single neurons were simultaneously recorded in this area, either during long periods of spontaneous behavior (including exploratory whisking) or controlled deflection of single whiskers. PCA rotated the matrices of correlation between these n neurons into a series of n uncorrelated principal components (PCs), each successive PC oriented to explain a maximum of the remaining variance. The fact that this transformation is mathematically equivalent to the general Hebb algorithm in linear neural networks provided a major rationale for performing it here on data from real neuronal ensembles. Typically, most information correlated across neurons in the ensemble was concentrated within the first 3-8 PCs. Each of these was found to encode distinct, and highly significant informational factors. These factor encodings were assessed in two ways, each making use of fact that each PC consisted of a matrix of weightings, one for each neuron. First, the neurons were rank ordered according to the locations of the central whiskers in their receptive fields, allowing their weightings within different PCs to be viewed as a function of their position within the whisker representation in the VPM. Each PC was found to define a distinctly different topographic mapping of the cutaneous surface. Next, the PCs were used to weight-sum the neurons' simultaneous activities to create population vectors (PVs). Each PV consisted of a single continuous time series which represented the expression of each PC's 'magnitude' in response to stimulation of different whiskers, or during behavioral events such as active tactile whisking. These showed that each PC functioned as a feature detector capable of selectively predicting significant sensory or behavioral events with far greater statistical reliability than could any single neuron. The encoding characteristics of the first few PCs were remarkably consistent across all animals and experimental conditions, including both spontaneous exploration and direct sensory stimulation: PC1 positively weighted all neurons, mainly according to their covariance. Thus it encoded global magnitude of ensemble activity, caused either by combined sensory inputs or intrinsic network activity, such as spontaneous oscillations. PC2 encoded spatial position contrast, generally in the rostrocaudal dimension, across the whole cutaneous surface represented by the ensemble. PC3 more selectively encoded contrast in an orthogonal (usually dorsoventral) dimension. A variable number of higher numbered PCs encoded local position contrast within one or more smaller regions of the cutaneous surface. The remaining PCs typically explained residual 'noise', i.e. the uncorrelated variance that constituted a major part of each neuron's activity. Differences in behavioral or sensory experience produced relatively little in the PC weighting patterns but often changed the variance they explained (eigenvalues) enough to alter their ordering. These results argue that PCA provides a powerful set of tools for selectively measuring neural ensemble activity within multiple functionally significant 'dimensions' of information processing. As such, it redefines the 'neuron' as an entity which contributes portions of its variance to processing not one, but several tasks.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neuroscience Methods", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0165-0270(99)00130-2", "citations": "116", "readership": "210", "tweets": "1", "news_mentions": " "},

Behaviorally, all participants responded faster and more accurately during the rhyme task compared to the semantic task. Moreover, older adults demonstrated higher response accuracy than younger adults during the semantic task. Although there were no overall age-related differences in the neuroimaging results, an Age×Task interaction was found in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), with older adults producing greater activation than younger adults during the semantic condition. These results suggest that at lower levels of task difficulty, older and younger adults engaged similar neural networks that benefited behavioral performance. As task difficulty increased during the semantic task, older adults relied more heavily on largely left hemisphere language regions, as well as regions involved in perception and internal monitoring.

Medication trials in MCI have generally failed, but new discoveries with brain plasticity in ageing have led to the study of cognitive training as a potential treatment to improve cognitive abilities. Computerised cognitive training (CCT) involves computerised cognitive exercises that target specific cognitive abilities and neural networks to potentially improve cognitive functioning through neuroplasticity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a two-site study (New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University Medical Center and Duke University Medical Center), we will randomise 100 patients with MCI (Wechsler Memory Scale-III Logical Memory II score 0-11; Folstein Mini Mental State Examination ≥23) to home-based CCT (suite of exercises: memory, matching, spatial recognition, processing speed) or a home-based active control condition (computerised crossword puzzle training (CPT)) with 12 weeks of intensive training followed by regular booster sessions up to 78 weeks. All patients will receive standard neuropsychological and functional assessments in clinic as well as structural/functional brain MRI scans at study entry and endpoint. We will test if CCT, versus CPT, leads to improved cognitive functioning, transfers to functional ability and tasks of everyday life and impacts hippocampal volume changes and changes in the default mode network of the brain measured by resting-state functional MRI. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted following ethics approval and written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects. Study results will be disseminated via publication, clinicaltrials.gov, media and conference presentations.

Although these treatments have been widely practiced, the mechanisms behind DBS and lesioning are still not well understood. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) are two common targets for both DBS and lesioning. Previous studies have indicated that DBS not only affects local cells within the target, but also passing axons within neighboring regions. Using a computational model of the basal ganglia-thalamic network, we studied the relative contributions of activation and silencing of local cells (LCs) and fibers of passage (FOPs) to changes in the accuracy of information transmission through the thalamus (thalamic fidelity), which is correlated with the effectiveness of DBS. Activation of both LCs and FOPs during STN and GPi-DBS were beneficial to the outcome of stimulation. During STN and GPi lesioning, effects of silencing LCs and FOPs were different between the two types of lesioning. For STN lesioning, silencing GPi FOPs mainly contributed to its effectiveness, while silencing only STN LCs did not improve thalamic fidelity. In contrast, silencing both GPi LCs and GPe FOPs during GPi lesioning contributed to improvements in thalamic fidelity. Thus, two distinct mechanisms produced comparable improvements in thalamic function: driving the output of the basal ganglia to produce tonic inhibition and silencing the output of the basal ganglia to produce tonic disinhibition. These results show the importance of considering effects of activating or silencing fibers passing close to the nucleus when deciding upon a target location for DBS or lesioning.", "publication_location": "Journal of Computational Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10827-011-0366-4", "citations": "53", "readership": "66", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Convolution neural networks (CNNs) are the heart of deep learning applications. Recent works PRIME [1] and ISAAC [2] demonstrated the promise of using resistive random access memory (ReRAM) to perform neural computations in memory. We found that training cannot be efficiently supported with the current schemes. First, they do not consider weight update and complex data dependency in training procedure. Second, ISAAC attempts to increase system throughput with a very deep pipeline. It is only beneficial when a large number of consecutive images can be fed into the architecture. In training, the notion of batch (e.g. 64) limits the number of images can be processed consecutively, because the images in the next batch need to be processed based on the updated weights. Third, the deep pipeline in ISAAC is vulnerable to pipeline bubbles and execution stall. In this paper, we present PipeLayer, a ReRAM-based PIM accelerator for CNNs that support both training and testing. We analyze data dependency and weight update in training algorithms and propose efficient pipeline to exploit inter-layer parallelism. To exploit intra-layer parallelism, we propose highly parallel design based on the notion of parallelism granularity and weight replication. With these design choices, PipeLayer enables the highly pipelined execution of both training and testing, without introducing the potential stalls in previous work.

Research has begun to emerge studying the potential synergistic actions of multi-modal, combination therapies. For example, NIBS combined with rehabilitation strategies have demonstrated some success for speech and motor rehabilitation in stroke patients. In this review we present evidence suggesting that combining NIBS with targeted, cognitive interventions offers a potentially powerful new approach to treating neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we focus on NIBS studies using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)2 and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)3 given that these modalities are relatively safe, noninvasive, and can be performed simultaneously with neurocognitive interventions. We review the concept of \"state dependent\" effects of NIBS and highlight how simultaneous or sequential cognitive interventions could help optimize NIBS therapy by providing further control of ongoing neural activity in targeted neural networks. This review spans a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, generalized anxiety, and autism. For each disorder, we emphasize neuroanatomical circuitry that could be engaged with combination therapy and critically discuss the literature that has begun to emerge.

Tools such as optogenetics, for example, are having a significant impact in the neuroscience field by delivering optical firing control with the precision and spatiotemporal resolution required for investigating information processing and plasticity in biological brains. While a number of training algorithms have been developed to date for spiking neural network (SNN) models of biological neuronal circuits, exiting methods rely on learning rules that adjust the synaptic strengths (or weights) directly, in order to obtain the desired network-level (or functional-level) performance. As such, they are not applicable to modifying plasticity in biological neuronal circuits, in which synaptic strengths only change as a result of pre- and post-synaptic neuron firings or biological mechanisms beyond our control. This paper presents a weight-free training algorithm that relies solely on adjusting the spatiotemporal delivery of neuron firings in order to optimize the network performance. The proposed weight-free algorithm does not require any knowledge of the SNN model or its plasticity mechanisms. As a result, this training approach is potentially realizable in vitro or in vivo via neural stimulation and recording technologies, such as optogenetics and multielectrode arrays, and could be utilized to control plasticity at multiple scales of biological neuronal circuits.

Here, we used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure brain activity during initial encoding and subsequent recognition of sentences and pictures. For each type of material, three recognition conditions were included which varied with respect to target density (0%, 50%, 100%). Analysis of large-scale activity patterns identified a collection of foci whose activity distinguished the processing of sentences vs. pictures. A second pattern, which showed strong prefrontal cortex involvement, distinguished the type of cognitive process (encoding or retrieval).

Although the pudendo-vesical reflex and its physiological properties are well established, there is limited understanding of the specific neural mechanisms that mediate this reflex. We sought to develop a computational model of the spinal neural network that governs the reflex bladder response to PN stimulation. We implemented and validated a neural network architecture based on previous neuroanatomical and electrophysiological studies. Using synaptically-connected integrate and fire model neurons, we created a network model with realistic spiking behavior. The model produced expected sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN) neuron firing rates from prescribed neural inputs and predicted bladder activation and inhibition with different frequencies of pudendal afferent stimulation. In addition, the model matched experimental results from previous studies of temporal patterns of pudendal afferent stimulation and selective pharmacological blockade of inhibitory neurons. The frequency- and pattern-dependent effects of pudendal afferent stimulation were determined by changes in firing rate of spinal interneurons, suggesting that neural network interactions at the lumbosacral level can mediate the bladder response to different frequencies or temporal patterns of pudendal afferent stimulation. Further, the anatomical structure of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in the network model was necessary and sufficient to reproduce the critical features of the pudendo-vesical reflex, and this model may prove useful to guide development of novel, more effective electrical stimulation techniques for bladder control.", "publication_location": "Journal of Computational Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10827-016-0597-5", "citations": "3", "readership": "28", "tweets": "1", "news_mentions": " "},

In order to train the MoE model efficiently, a matrix factorization method is applied, by extending each weight matrix of the RNN to be an ensemble of topic-dependent weight matrices. The degree to which each member of the ensemble is used is tied to the document-dependent probability of the corresponding topics.

METHODS: Between May 2007 and September 2014, 24 recurrent and 22 remitted patients diagnosed with MDD with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I), and 69 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and educational level participated in this study. Among them, 1 healthy control was excluded due to excessive head motion. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) was assessed for all recruited subjects during the completion of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Relationships between fALFF and clinical measurements, including number of depressive episodes and illness duration, were examined. RESULTS: Compared to patients with remitted MDD and to healthy controls, patients with recurrent MDD exhibited decreased fALFF in the right posterior insula and right precuneus and increased fALFF in the left ventral anterior cingulate cortex. Decreased fALFF in the right precuneus and increased fALFF in the right middle insula were correlated with the number of depressive episodes in the recurrent MDD groups (r = -0.75, P < .01 and r = 0.78, P < .01, respectively) and remitted MDD groups (r = -0.63, P < .01 and r = 0.41, P = .03, respectively). In addition to regions in the default mode network (DMN) and salience network, the altered resting-state activity in the middle temporal and visual cortices was also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Altered resting-state activity was observed across several neural networks in patients with recurrent MDD.

The difficulty in separating indirect effects of impairments in attention and memory from direct effects on timing mechanisms is addressed. The main premise is that normal aging is commonly associated with increased noise and temporal uncertainty as a result of impairments in attention and memory as well as the possible reduction in the accuracy and precision of a central timing mechanism supported by dopamine-glutamate interactions in cortico-striatal circuits. Pertinent to these findings, potential interventions that may reduce the likelihood of observing age-related declines in timing are discussed. Bayesian optimization models are able to account for the adaptive changes observed in time perception by assuming that older adults are more likely to base their temporal judgments on statistical inferences derived from multiple trials than on a single trial's clock reading, which is more susceptible to distortion. We propose that the timing functions assigned to the age-sensitive fronto-striatal network can be subserved by other neural networks typically associated with finely-tuned perceptuo-motor adjustments, through degeneracy principles (different structures serving a common function).", "publication_location": "Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00102", "citations": "38", "readership": "95", "tweets": "3", "news_mentions": " "},

To a large extent, however, current reinforcement learning algorithms draw upon machine learning techniques that are at least ten years old and, with a few exceptions, very little has been done to exploit recent advances in classification learning for the purposes of reinforcement learning. We use a variant of approximate policy iteration based on rollouts that allows us to use a pure classification learner, such as a support vector machine (SVM), in the inner loop of the algorithm. We argue that the use of SVMs, particularly in combination with the kernel trick, can make it easier to apply reinforcement learning as an \"out-of-the-box\" technique, without extensive feature engineering. Our approach opens the door to modern classification methods, but does not preclude the use of classical methods.

We describe when and where each one of these components is first identified in the CNS and the changes in their levels that occur during the course of prenatal and postnatal development. We also describe how these components are relevant to many events that occur during the development of the CNS, including progenitor cells proliferation and differentiation, neurogenesis, gliogenesis, neuronal maturation and plasticity, axonal pathfinding, regulation of gene expression and cell survival.

All rights reserved. Phenomenally successful in practical inference problems, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are widely deployed in mobile devices, data centers, and even supercomputers. The number of parameters needed in CNNs, however, are often large and undesirable. Consequently, various methods have been developed to prune a CNN once it is trained. Nevertheless, the resulting CNNs offer limited benefits. While pruning the fully connected layers reduces a CNN's size considerably, it does not improve inference speed noticeably as the compute heavy parts lie in convolutions. Pruning CNNs in a way that increase inference speed often imposes specific sparsity structures, thus limiting the achievable sparsity levels. We present a method to realize simultaneously size economy and speed improvement while pruning CNNs. Paramount to our success is an efficient general sparse-with-dense matrix multiplication implementation that is applicable to convolution of feature maps with kernels of arbitrary sparsity patterns. Complementing this, we developed a performance model that predicts sweet spots of sparsity levels for different layers and on different computer architectures. Together, these two allow us to demonstrate 3.1-7.3× convolution speedups over dense convolution in AlexNet, on Intel Atom, Xeon, and Xeon Phi processors, spanning the spectrum from mobile devices to supercomputers.", "publication_location": "5th International Conference on Learning Representations, Iclr 2017   Conference Track Proceedings", "link": null, "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The goals of this paper are to: 1) determine the impact of process-level information on machine learning prediction results and 2) establish the effect of type of machine learning algorithm used on prediction results. Data were collected from a university level course in human factors engineering (n =35), which included both traditional classroom assessment and computer-based assessment methods. A set of common regression and classification algorithms were applied to the data to predict final course score. The overall prediction accuracy as well as the chronological progression of prediction accuracy was analyzed for each algorithm. Simple machine learning algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression) had comparable performance with more complex methods (support vector machines, artificial neural networks). Process-level information was not useful in post-hoc predictions, but contributed significantly to allowing for accurate predictions to be made earlier in the course. Process level information provides useful prediction features for development of targeted intervention techniques, as it allows more accurate predictions to be made earlier in the course.

As maintenance of cellular excitability and firing properties is essential for interneurons to regulate neural networks, we investigated these aspects of interneuronal function after transient cerebral ischemia in rats. Cerebral ischemia in rats was induced for 8 mins by a combination of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion and hypovolemic hypotension, and whole cell patch clamp recordings were made in hippocampal slices prepared 24 h after reperfusion. Interneurons located within stratum pyramidale of area CA1 exhibited normal membrane properties and action potentials under these conditions. However, their excitability had declined, as evidenced by an increased action potential threshold and a rightward shift in the relationship between injected depolarizing current and firing rate. Voltage-clamp experiments revealed that transient cerebral ischemia reduced the peak Na(+) current and shifted Na(+) channel activation to more depolarized values, but did not alter steady-state inactivation of the channel. Double immunofluorescence cytochemistry showed that transient cerebral ischemia also reduced Na(v)1.1 subunit immunoreactivity in interneurons that coexpressed parvalbumin. We conclude that transient cerebral ischemia renders CA1 interneurons less excitable, that depressed excitability involves impaired Na(+) channel activation and that Na(+) channel dysfunction is explained, at least in part, by reduced expression of the Na(v)1.1 subunit.

We have developed a bioinformatic assessment tool, the cleavage of radiolabeled protein (CRP) program, which enables experimental identification of phosphorylation sites via (32)P labeling and Edman degradation of cleaved proteins obtained at femtomole levels. By observing the Edman cycle(s) in which radioactivity is found, candidate phosphorylation sites are identified by determining which residues occur at the observed number of cycles downstream from a peptide cleavage site. In cases where more than one residue could be responsible for the observed radioactivity, additional experiments with cleavage reagents having alternative specificities may resolve the ambiguity. Given a protein sequence and a cleavage site, CRP performs these experiments in silico, identifying resolved sites based on user-supplied experimental data, as well as suggesting combinations of reagents for additional analyses. Analysis of the PhosphoBase protein sequence database suggests that CRP data from two cleavage experiments can be used to identify unambiguously 60% of known phosphorylation sites. Data from additional cleavage experiments may increase the overall coverage to 70% of known sites. By comparing theoretical data obtained from the CRP program with (32)P release data obtained from an Edman sequencer, a known phosphorylation site was identified unambiguously and correctly.

We constructed a model of AMPA channel activation that accounts for the responses to controlled glutamate application and a model of glutamate diffusion in the synaptic cleft. With no further adjustments to these models, we simulated the response to the release of glutamate from a single vesicle. The predicted response closely matches the rise time of observed responses, which recent measurements show is much faster (<100 micros) than previously thought. The simulations show that initial channel opening is driven by a brief (<100 micros) glutamate spike near the site of vesicle fusion, producing a hotspot of channel activation (diameter: approximately 250 nm) smaller than many synapses. Quantal size therefore depends more strongly on the density of channels than their number, a finding that has important implications for measuring synaptic strength. Recent measurements allow estimation of AMPA receptor density at CA1 synapses. Using this value, our simulations correctly predicts a quantal amplitude of approximately 10 pA. We have also analyzed the properties of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) generated by the multivesicular release that can occur during evoked responses. We find that summation is nearly linear and that the existence of multiple narrow peaks in amplitude histograms can be accounted for. It has been unclear how to reconcile the existence of these narrow peaks, which indicate that the variation of quantal amplitude is small (CV < 0.2) with the highly variable amplitude of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs; CV approximately 0.6). According to one theory, mEPSC variability arises from variation in vesicle glutamate content. However, both our modeling results and recent experimental results indicate that this view cannot account for the observed rise time/amplitude correlation of mEPSCs. In contrast, this correlation and the high mEPSC variability can be accounted for if some mEPSCs are generated by two or more vesicles released with small temporal jitter. We conclude that a broad range of results can be accounted for by simple principles: quantal amplitude (approximately 10 pA) is stereotyped, some mEPSCs are multivesicular at moderate and large synapses, and evoked responses are generated by quasi-linear summation of multiple quanta.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neurophysiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00258.2004", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Long-term depression (LTD), an activity-dependent decrease in synaptic efficacy, may be an equally important mechanism which permits neural networks to store information more effectively. One form of LTD that has been observed in the hippocampus requires activation of postsynaptic NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, a change in postsynaptic calcium concentration, and activation of postsynaptic serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) or 2A (PP2A). The mechanism by which PP1 or PP2A is regulated by synaptic activity is unclear because these protein phosphatases are not directly influenced by calcium concentration. LTD induction may require activation of a more complex protein phosphatase cascade consisting of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin, its phosphoprotein substrate, inhibitor-1, and PP1. We tested this hypothesis using calcineurin inhibitors as well as different forms of inhibitor-1 loaded into postsynaptic cells. Our results suggest a signalling pathway in which calcineurin dephosphorylates and inactivates inhibitor-1.

These receptors are present at both pre- and postsynaptic sites and can exert both inhibitory and disinhibitory effects. In particular, GABAB receptors are important in regulating NMDA receptor-mediated responses, including the induction of LTP. They also can regulate the filtering properties of neural networks, allowing peak transmission in the frequency range of theta rhythm. Finally, GABAB receptors are G protein-coupled to a variety of intracellular effector systems, and thereby have the potential to produce long-term changes in the state of neuronal activity, through actions such as protein phosphorylation. Although the majority of the effects of GABAB receptors have been reported in vitro, recent studies have also demonstrated that GABAB receptors exert electrophysiological actions in vivo. For example, GABAB receptor antagonists reduce the late IPSP in vivo and consequently can decrease inhibition of spontaneous neuronal firing following a stimulus (Lingenhöhl and Olpe, 1993). In addition, blockade of GABAB receptors can increase spontaneous activity of central neurons, suggesting the presence of GABAB receptor-mediated tonic inhibition (Andre et al., 1992; Lingenhöhl and Olpe, 1993). Despite these electrophysiological effects, antagonism of GABAB receptors has generally been reported to produce few behavioral actions. This lack of overt behavioral effects most likely reflects the modulatory nature of the receptor action. Nevertheless, two separate behavioral studies have recently reported an enhancement of cognitive performance in several different animal species following blockade of GABAB receptors (Mondadori et al., 1992; Carletti et al., 1993). Because of their small number of side effects, GABAB receptor antagonists may represent effective therapeutic tools for modulation of cognition. Alternatively, the lack of overt behavioral effects of GABAB receptors may indicate that these receptors are more important in pathologic rather than normal physiological states (Wojcik et al., 1989). For example, a change in receptor affinity or receptor number brought on by the pathology could enhance the effectiveness of GABAB receptors. Of significance, CGP 35348 has been shown to block absence seizures in genetically seizure prone animals, while inducing no seizures in control animals (Hosford et al., 1992; Liu et al., 1992). Thus, GABAB receptors may represent effective sites for pharmacological regulation of absence seizures. Perhaps further behavioral effects of these receptors will become apparent only after additional studies have been performed using the highly potent antagonists that have been recently introduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "publication_location": "International Review of Neurobiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0074-7742(08)60304-9", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The dataset properties which were varied include dimension of the data, the true dimension of the embedded structure, the sample size, the amount of noise, and the complexity of the embedded structure.

In medicine, both ethical and monetary costs of incorrect predictions can be significant, and the complexity of the problems often necessitates increasingly complex models. Recent work has shown that changing just the random seed is enough for otherwise well-tuned deep neural networks to vary in their individual predicted probabilities. In light of this, we investigate the role of model uncertainty methods in the medical domain. Using RNN ensembles and various Bayesian RNNs, we show that population-level metrics, such as AUC-PR, AUC-ROC, log-likelihood, and calibration error, do not capture model uncertainty. Meanwhile, the presence of significant variability in patient-specific predictions and optimal decisions motivates the need for capturing model uncertainty. Understanding the uncertainty for individual patients is an area with clear clinical impact, such as determining when a model decision is likely to be brittle. We further show that RNNs with only Bayesian embeddings can be a more efficient way to capture model uncertainty compared to ensembles, and we analyze how model uncertainty is impacted across individual input features and patient subgroups.", "publication_location": "Acm Chil 2020   Proceedings of the 2020 Acm Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3368555.3384457", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Defects in TSVs due to fabrication steps decrease the yield and reliability of 3D stacked ICs, hence these defects need to be screened early in the manufacturing flow. We propose a non-invasive method for pre-bond TSV test and diagnosis that does not require TSV probing. We use open TSVs as capacitive loads of their driving gates and measure the propagation delay by means of ring oscillators. Defects in TSVs cause variations in their RC parameters and therefore lead to variations in the propagation delay. By measuring these variations, we can detect resistive open and leakage faults. In addition, we use duty-cycle detectors to measure the duty cycle of the oscillation signal. These measurements provide additional information for fault analysis and hence increase the diagnosis accuracy. We exploit different voltage levels to increase the sensitivity of the test and its robustness against random process variations. We also present a method to create a regression model based on artificial neural networks to predict the fault size. As input, this model uses both the oscillation period and the duty cycle measured at multiple different voltage levels. The model classifies the type of the fault and predicts its size. Moreover, the regression model can effectively determine whether a TSV has both leakage and resistive-open defects.

In this study we examine the effect of the WBI on the responses to complex sound stimuli such as broadband noise (BBN), notch noise, noise bands, and band/notch combinations. A new and more realistic model for auditory nerve (AN) response in the presence of different levels of noise is used. It is shown that one can explain and understand the qualitative features of virtually all the published data on type II and type IV unit responses to BBN, notch noise and noise bands. The monotone decreasing response of the maximum firing rate of type II units to noise bands of increasing width that is observed experimentally occurs in the model due to the increasing inhibition of type II cells by the WBI. Similarly, the various nonmonotone patterns of maximum firing rate of type IV units to noise bands of increasing width is shown to arise from the complex and highly nonlinear effects of inhibition from the type II to type IV and the WBI to type IV cells and the nonlinear direct excitation from the AN to the type IV cells.

Recent advances in deep learning for neural networks with large numbers of parameters have been enabled by automatic differentiation, an algorithmic technique for calculating gradients of measures of model fit with respect to model parameters. Estimation of high-dimensional parameter sets is an important problem within the hydrological sciences. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of gradient-based estimation techniques for high-dimensional inverse estimation problems using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model. In particular, we compare the effectiveness of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and automatic differentiation variational inference against two nongradient-dependent methods, random walk Metropolis and differential evolution Metropolis. We show that the former two techniques exhibit superior performance for inverse estimation of daily rainfall values and are much more computationally efficient on larger data sets in an experiment with synthetic data. We also present a case study evaluating the effectiveness of automatic differentiation variational inference for inverse estimation over 25 years of daily precipitation conditional on streamflow observations at three catchments and show that it is scalable to very high dimensional parameter spaces. The presented results highlight the power of combining hydrological process-based models with optimization techniques from deep learning for high-dimensional estimation problems.", "publication_location": "Water Resources Research", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018WR024461", "citations": "1", "readership": "24", "tweets": "2", "news_mentions": " "},

With the identification of several well-replicated risk factors for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of legal blindness in older adults, this previously unreachable goal is beginning to seem less elusive. However, recently developed algorithms have either been much less accurate than expected, given the strong effects of the identified risk factors, or have not been applied to independent datasets, leaving unknown how well they would perform in the population at large. We sought to increase accuracy by using novel modeling strategies, including multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and grammatical evolution of neural networks (GENN), in addition to the traditional logistic regression approach. Furthermore, we rigorously designed and tested our models in three distinct datasets: a Vanderbilt-Miami (VM) clinic-based case-control dataset, a VM family dataset, and the population-based Age-related Maculopathy Ancillary (ARMA) Study cohort. Using a consensus approach to combine the results from logistic regression and GENN models, our algorithm was successful in differentiating between high- and low-risk groups (sensitivity 77.0%, specificity 74.1%). In the ARMA cohort, the positive and negative predictive values were 63.3% and 70.7%, respectively. We expect that future efforts to refine this algorithm by increasing the sample size available for model building, including novel susceptibility factors as they are discovered, and by calibrating the model for diverse populations will improve accuracy.", "publication_location": "Plos One", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017784", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

We can handle very many control variables, endogenous receipt of treatment, heterogeneous treatment effects, and function-valued outcomes. Our framework covers the special case of exogenous receipt of treatment, either conditional on controls or unconditionally as in randomized control trials. In the latter case, our approach produces efficient estimators and honest bands for (functional) average treatment effects (ATE) and quantile treatment effects (QTE). To make informative inference possible, we assume that key reduced-form predictive relationships are approximately sparse. This assumption allows the use of regularization and selection methods to estimate those relations, and we provide methods for post-regularization and post-selection inference that are uniformly valid (honest) across a wide range of models. We show that a key ingredient enabling honest inference is the use of orthogonal or doubly robust moment conditions in estimating certain reduced-form functional parameters. We illustrate the use of the proposed methods with an application to estimating the effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on accumulated assets. The results on program evaluation are obtained as a consequence of more general results on honest inference in a general moment-condition framework, which arises from structural equation models in econometrics. Here, too, the crucial ingredient is the use of orthogonal moment conditions, which can be constructed from the initial moment conditions. We provide results on honest inference for (function-valued) parameters within this general framework where any high-quality, machine learning methods (e.g., boosted trees, deep neural networks, random forest, and their aggregated and hybrid versions) can be used to learn the nonparametric/high-dimensional components of the model. These include a number of supporting auxiliary results that are of major independent interest: namely, we (1) prove uniform validity of a multiplier bootstrap, (2) offer a uniformly valid functional delta method, and (3) provide results for sparsity-based estimation of regression functions for function-valued outcomes.", "publication_location": "Econometrica", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3982/ECTA12723", "citations": "55", "readership": "237", "tweets": "11", "news_mentions": " "},

In this paper, we attempted to address this challenge by answering the following questions: (1) if the pain has dependency structures in electronic signals and if so, (2) how to apply this pattern in predicting the state of pain. To this end, we have been investigating and comparing the performance of several machine learning techniques.We first adopted different strategies, in which the collected original n-dimensional numerical data were converted into binary data. Pain states are represented in binary format and bound with above binary features to construct (n + 1) -dimensional data. We then modeled the joint distribution over all variables in this data using the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM).Seventy-eight pain data items were collected. Four individuals with the number of recorded labels larger than 1000 were used in the experiment. Number of avaliable data items for the four patients varied from 22 to 28. Discriminant RBM achieved better accuracy in all four experiments.The experimental results show that RBM models the distribution of our binary pain data well. We showed that discriminant RBM can be used in a classification task, and the initial result is advantageous over other classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) using PCA representation and the LDA discriminant method.", "publication_location": "Bmc Medical Informatics and Decision Making", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12911-016-0317-0", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

It is therefore essential to understand quantitatively how CCFs are shaped by different factors, such as connectivity, synaptic parameters, and background activity. Here, we study the CCF between two neurons using analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We quantify the role of synaptic parameters, such as peak conductance, decay time, and reversal potential, and analyze how various patterns of connectivity influence CCF shapes. In particular, we find that the symmetry of the CCF distinguishes in general, but not always, the case of shared inputs between two neurons from the case in which they are directly synaptically connected. We systematically examine the influence of background synaptic inputs from the surrounding network that set the baseline firing statistics of the neurons and modulate their response properties. We find that variations in the background noise modify the amplitude of the cross-correlation function as strongly as variations of synaptic strength. In particular, we show that the postsynaptic neuron spiking regularity has a pronounced influence on CCF amplitude. This suggests an efficient and flexible mechanism for modulating functional interactions.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1275-09.2009", "citations": "143", "readership": "346", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

According to this theory, plasticity at the Parallel Fiber (PF) to Purkinje Cell (PC) synapses is guided by the Climbing fibers (CF), which encode an 'error signal'. Purkinje cells have thus been modeled as perceptrons, learning input/output binary associations. At maximal capacity, a perceptron with excitatory weights expresses a large fraction of zero-weight synapses, in agreement with experimental findings. However, numerous experiments indicate that the firing rate of Purkinje cells varies in an analog, not binary, manner. In this paper, we study the perceptron with analog inputs and outputs. We show that the optimal input has a sparse binary distribution, in good agreement with the burst firing of the Granule cells. In addition, we show that the weight distribution consists of a large fraction of silent synapses, as in previously studied binary perceptron models, and as seen experimentally.", "publication_location": "Plos Computational Biology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002919", "citations": "18", "readership": "69", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

However, most previous studies have used experimental paradigms in which choices are discrete (and few), play is static, and optimal solutions are known. Yet in natural environments, interactions between agents typically involve continuous action spaces, ongoing dynamics, and no known optimal solution. Here, we seek to bridge this divide by using a \"penalty shot\" task in which pairs of monkeys competed against each other in a competitive, real-time video game. We modeled monkeys' strategies as driven by stochastically evolving goals, onscreen positions that served as set points for a control model that produced observed joystick movements. We fit this goal-based dynamical system model using approximate Bayesian inference methods, using neural networks to parameterize players' goals as a dynamic mixture of Gaussian components. Our model is conceptually simple, constructed of interpretable components, and capable of generating synthetic data that capture the complexity of real player dynamics. We further characterized players' strategies using the number of change points on each trial. We found that this complexity varied more across sessions than within sessions, and that more complex strategies benefited offensive players but not defensive players. Together, our experimental paradigm and model offer a powerful combination of tools for the study of realistic social dynamics in the laboratory setting.", "publication_location": "Plos Computational Biology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006895", "citations": "3", "readership": "18", "tweets": "2", "news_mentions": " "},

The three visual motion signals are summed and integrated to produce the eye velocity output of the model. The model reproduces the average eye velocity evoked by steps of target velocity in monkeys and humans and accounts for the variation among individual responses and subjects. When its motor pathways are expanded to include positive feedback of eye velocity and a \"switch\", the model reproduces the exponential decay in eye velocity observed when a moving target stops.

It has been suggested that the beneficial effect of nicotine replacement therapy may be mediated partly by the ability of nicotine to reduce distraction by such stimuli and thereby to facilitate attention to task-relevant stimuli. The present study tested the hypothesis that nicotine reduces distraction by aversive and smoking-related stimuli as indexed by the parietal P3b brain response to a task-relevant target digit. We assessed the effect of nicotine on distraction by emotionally negative, positive, neutral, and smoking-related pictures immediately preceding target digits during a rapid visual information processing task in 16 smokers in a double-blind, counterbalanced, within-subjects design. The study included two experimental sessions. After overnight smoking deprivation (12+ hr), active nicotine patches were applied to participants during one of the sessions and placebo patches were applied during the other session. Nicotine enhanced P3b responses associated with target digits immediately subsequent to negative emotional pictures bilaterally and subsequent to smoking-related pictures only in the right hemisphere. No effects of nicotine were observed for P3bs subsequent to positive and neutral distractor pictures. Another measure of attention, contingent negative variation amplitude in anticipation of the target digits also was increased by nicotine, especially in the left hemisphere and at posterior sites. Together, these findings suggest that nicotine reduces the distraction by emotionally negative and smoking-related stimuli and promotes attention to task-related stimuli by modulating somewhat lateralized and task-specific neural networks.", "publication_location": "Nicotine & Tobacco Research : Official Journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14622200701188810", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

In segmentation the goal is to provide a dense pixel-wise labeling of the input imagery. However, remote sensing imagery is usually stored in the form of very large images, called “tiles”, which are too large to be segmented directly using most CNNs and their associated hardware. During label inference (i.e., obtaining labels for a new large tile) smaller sub-images, called “patches”, are extracted uniformly over a tile and the resulting label maps are “stitched” (or concatenated) to create a tile-sized label map. This approach suffers from computational inefficiency and risks of discontinuities at the boundaries between the output of individual patches. In this work we propose a simple alternative approach in which the input size of the CNN is dramatically increased only during label inference. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against a standard stitching approach using two popular segmentation CNN models on the INRIA building labeling dataset. The results suggest that the proposed approach substantially reduces label inference time, while also yielding modest overall label accuracy increases.

In this work, we consider the adversarial discriminative domain adaptation (ADDA) approach to address this limitation, due its recent success on related problems. A limitation of ADDA is that it is unsupervised, so in this work we extend ADDA to a semi-supervised algorithm, in which we assume that both labeled and unlabeled data are available in the new domain (e.g., in new geographic region to be evaluated). We compare semisupervised ADDA to ADDA and a standard fine-tuning approach wherein available labeled data is used for standard CNN training.

Long-term exposure to ambient ozone (O3) is associated with a variety of impacts, including adverse humanhealth effects and reduced yields in commercial crops. Ground-level O3 concentrations for assessments are typically predicted using chemical transport models; however such methods often feature biases that can influence impact estimates. Here, we develop and apply artificial neural networks to empirically model long-term O3 exposure over the continental United States from 2000 to 2015, and we generate a measurement-based assessment of impacts on human-health and crop yields. Notably, we found that two commonly used human-health averaging metrics, based on separate epidemiological studies, differ in their trends over the study period. The population-weighted, April-September average of the daily 1 h maximum concentration peaked in 2002 at 55.9 ppb and decreased by 0:43 [95 % CI: 0:28, 0:57] ppb yr-1 between 2000 and 2015, yielding an ∼ 18 % decrease in normalized human-health impacts. In contrast, there was little change in the population-weighted, annual average of the maximum daily 8 h average concentration between 2000 and 2015, which resulted in a ∼ 5 % increase in normalized human-health impacts. In both cases, an aging population structure played a substantial role in modulating these trends. Trends of all agriculture-weighted crop-loss metrics indicated yield improvements, with reductions in the estimated national relative yield loss ranging from 1.7 % to 1.9 % for maize, 5.1 % to 7.1 % for soybeans, and 2.7 % for wheat.

RRAM-based computing-in-memory engines provide a promising platform to accelerate deep neural networks. The programming process imposes high voltages onto the RRAM cells and thus degrades their valid conductance ranges from the fresh state, an effect called aging. Consequently, the expected conductances of RRAM cells corresponding to the weights after training may fall outside of the valid ranges, potentially leading to a significant accuracy degradation. In addition, an uneven temperature distribution due to different conductances accelerates the aging effect further. Moreover, the uneven temperatures can cause accuracy discrepancy between the tuning process and inference, thus reducing the lifetime of such accelerators even further. In this paper, we propose to counter aging and thermal effects by distributing aging stress and high-temperature RRAM cells evenly, during both software training and hardware mapping, to extend the lifetime of computing-in-memory engines.

In this paper, we propose a novel neuron design based on pulse width modulation, avoiding the quantization step and bypassing spike mismatch via the continuous activation. The computation latency and circuit complexity can significantly be reduced due to the absence of quantization and digital processing steps, while keeping a competitive performance.

The ability to predict accurately the response to adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or tamoxifen therapy) or postlumpectomy radiation therapy in these patients can be vital to their survival, because this prediction determines the best postsurgical therapy for each patient. METHODS: This study evaluated data from 226 patients with TNM Stage I and early Stage II breast carcinoma and included the variables p53 and c-erbB-2 (HER-2/neu). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) was the measure of predictive accuracy. The prediction endpoints were 5- and 10-year overall survival. RESULTS: For Stage I and early Stage II patients, the 5- and 10-year predictive accuracy of the TNM staging system were at chance level, i.e., no better than flipping a coin. Both the 5- and 10-year artificial neural networks (ANNs) were very accurate--significantly more so than the TNM staging system (Az 5-year survival, TNM = 0.567, ANN = 0.758; P < 0.001; Az 10-year survival, TNM = 0.508, ANN = 0.894; P < 0.0001). For patients not receiving postsurgical therapy and for either chemotherapy or tamoxifen therapy, the ANNs containing p53 and c-erbB-2 and the number of positive lymph nodes were accurate predictors of survival (Az 5-year survival, 0.781, 0.789, and 0.720, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The molecular genetic variables p53 and c-erbB-2 and the number of positive lymph nodes are powerful predictors of survival, and using ANN statistical models is a powerful method for predicting responses to adjuvant therapy or radiation therapy in patients with breast carcinoma.

This article presents measurements of the t-channel single top-quark (t) and top-antiquark (t¯) total production cross sections σ(tq) and σ(t¯q), their ratio Rt=σ(tq)/σ(t¯q), and a measurement of the inclusive production cross section σ(tq+t¯q) in proton-proton collisions at √s=7 TeV at the LHC. Differential cross sections for the tq and t¯q processes are measured as a function of the transverse momentum and the absolute value of the rapidity of t and t¯, respectively. The analyzed data set was recorded with the ATLAS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.59 fb-1. Selected events contain one charged lepton, large missing transverse momentum, and two or three jets. The cross sections are measured by performing a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the output distributions of neural networks. The resulting measurements are σ(tq)=46±1(stat)±6(syst) pb, σ(t¯q)=23±1(stat)±3(syst) pb, Rt=2.04±0.13(stat)±0.12(syst), and σ(tq+t¯q)=68±2(stat)±8(syst) pb, consistent with the Standard Model expectation. The uncertainty on the measured cross sections is dominated by systematic uncertainties, while the uncertainty on Rt is mainly statistical.

Many hospitals keep a record of dose after each patient's CT scan to monitor and manage radiation risks. To facilitate risk management, it is essential to use the most relevant metric, which is the patient-specific organ dose. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a patient-specific and automated organ dose estimation framework. This framework includes both patient and radiation exposure modeling. From patient CT images, major organs were automatically segmented using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Smaller organs and structures that were not otherwise segmented were automatically filled in by deforming a matched XCAT phantom from an existing library of models. The organ doses were then estimated using a validated Monte Carlo (PENELOPE) simulation. The segmentation and deformation components of the framework were validated independently. The segmentation methods were trained and validated using 50-patient CT datasets that were manually delineated. The deformation methods were validated using a leave-one-out technique across 50 existing XCAT phantoms that were deformed to create a patient-specific XCAT for each of 50 targets. Both components were evaluated in terms of dice similarity coefficients (DSC) and organ dose. For dose comparisons, a clinical chest-abdomen-pelvis protocol was simulated under fixed tube current (mA). The organ doses were estimated by a validated Monte Carlo package and compared between automated and manual segmentation and between patient-specific XCAT phantoms and their corresponding XCAT targets. Organ dose for phantoms from automated vs. manual segmentation showed a ∼2% difference, and organ dose for phantoms deformed by the study vs. their targets showed a variation of ∼5% for most organs.

Frequency of activity was compared during over and silent object naming, word reading and line-matching. Although all recordings were from the cortex not essential for language, statistically significant changes in activity during these tasks were identified in 49% of the populations.

There were no significant differences in the proportion of neurons changing activity with language or spatial measures between right (non-dominant) or left (dominant) temporal lobes. Left superior and middle temporal gyrus populations, however, demonstrated significant early reductions in activity during overt or silent naming, while right middle temporal gyrus recordings showed significant early increased activity only during overt naming. Although reading measures elicited more activity from the non-dominant temporal lobe, early reductions in activity were recorded exclusively from the dominant side. Visuospatial tasks evoked changes in neuronal frequency predominantly in the middle temporal gyrus, and during one of these tasks, significant later increases in activity were present bilaterally.

We tested several hypotheses with respect to the mechanisms and processes that control the firing characteristics and determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of intracellular Ca2+ in CA3 hippocampal neurons. In particular, we were interested to know 1) whether bursting and nonbursting behavior of CA3 neurons could be accounted for in a morphologically realistic model using a number of the known ionic conductances; 2) whether such a model is robust across different cell morphologies; 3) whether some particular nonuniform distribution of Ca2+ channels is required for bursting; and 4) whether such a model can reproduce the magnitude and spatial distribution of intracellular Ca2+ transients determined from fluorescence imaging studies and can predict reasonable intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) distribution for CA3 neurons. 2. For this purpose we have developed a highly detailed model of the distribution and densities of membrane ion channels in hippocampal CA3 bursting and nonbursting pyramidal neurons. This model reproduces both the experimentally observed firing modes and the dynamics of intracellular Ca2+. 3. The kinetics of the membrane ionic conductances are based on available experimental data. This model incorporates a single Na+ channel, three Ca2+ channels (CaN, CaL, and CaT), three Ca(2+)-independent K+ channels (KDR, KA, and KM), two Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels (KC and KAHP), and intracellular Ca(2+)-related processes such as buffering, pumping, and radial diffusion. 4. To test the robustness of the model, we applied it to six different morphologically accurate reconstructions of CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In every neuron, Ca2+ channels, Ca(2+)-related processes, and Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels were uniformly distributed over the entire cell. Ca(2+)-independent K+ channels were placed on the soma and the proximal apical dendrites. For each reconstructed cell we were able to reproduce bursting and nonbursting firing characteristics as well as Ca2+ transients and distributions for both somatic and synaptic stimulations. 5. Our simulation results suggest that CA3 pyramidal cell bursting behavior does not require any special distribution of Ca(2+)-dependent channels and mechanisms. Furthermore, a simple increase in the Ca(2+)-independent K+ conductances is sufficient to change the firing mode of our CA3 neurons from bursting to nonbursting. 6. The model also displays [Ca2+]i transients and distributions that are consistent with fluorescent imaging data. Peak [Ca2+]i distribution for synaptic stimulation of the nonbursting model is broader when compared with somatic stimulation. Somatic stimulation of the bursting model shows a broader distribution in [Ca2+]i when compared with the nonbursting model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "publication_location": "Journal of Neurophysiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.1995.73.3.1157", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Not all patients with relapsing disease have an equal risk of death due to prostate cancer. After surgery, biochemical failure can be defined as persisting detectable levels of PSA after radical prostatectomy or a PSA rise after a period of normalization. On the other hand, definitions of PSA progression after radiation therapy vary and no clear consensus can be found. This review of the recent international literature updates the knowledge about the diagnostic procedures used in relapsing patients. Predictors of progression are precised leading to a better patient selection, based on currently available tables and nomograms. Indeed, identification of high risk patients may allow a more appropriate treatment decision. After radical treatment, the analysis of time to recurrence, PSA doubling time, PSA kinetics combined to modern imaging techniques such as 111In capromab penditide scan may allow a better identification of the recurrence site. Thus, an optimal treatment strategy may be envisaged such as local irradiation, salvage surgery, hormone therapy or combinations for which indications and results are provided. Alternative options such as cryotherapy still need further investigation.

Albumin levels were analyzed and compared to the values of standard prognostic factors to assess the ability of albumin to predict pathological stage and serological recurrence by PSA level after radical prostatectomy. Albumin level was not of value in predicting serological disease recurrence, but interestingly was an independent prognostic factor in predicting risk of nonorgan-confined disease (T3 or T4). Our data also showed that, as expected, grade and pretreatment PSA levels were independent predictors of pathological stage. Albumin appears to be of clinical utility to augment assessment of pretreatment pathological stage.

Deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in particular are increasingly popular tools for segmentation and classification of medical images. CNNs were shown to be successful for segmentation of brain tumors into multiple regions or labels. However, in the environment which fosters data-sharing and collection of multi-institutional datasets, a question arises: does training with data from another institution with potentially different imaging equipment, contrast protocol, and patient population impact the segmentation performance of the CNN? Our study presents preliminary data towards answering this question. Specifically, we used MRI data of glioblastoma (GBM) patients for two institutions present in The Cancer Imaging Archive. We performed a process of training and testing CNN multiple times such that half of the time the CNN was tested on data from the same institution that was used for training and half of the time it was tested on another institution, keeping the training and testing set size constant. We observed a decrease in performance as measured by Dice coefficient when the CNN was trained with data from a different institution as compared to training with data from the same institution. The changes in performance for the entire tumor and for four different labels within the tumor were: 0.72 to 0.65 (p=0.06), 0.61 to 0.58 (p=0.49), 0.54 to 0.51 (p=0.82), 0.31 to 0.24 (p<0.03), and 0.43 to 0.31(p<0.003) respectively.

The underlying hypothesis is that user models can be developed to capture the individual error making patterns of radiologists-in-training. In this pilot study, the authors test the above hypothesis for the task of breast cancer diagnosis in mammograms. METHODS: The concept of a user model was formalized as the function that relates image features to the likelihood/extent of the diagnostic error made by a radiologist-in-training and therefore to the level of difficulty that a case will pose to the radiologist-in-training (or \"user\"). Then, machine learning algorithms were implemented to build such user models. Specifically, the authors explored k-nearest neighbor, artificial neural networks, and multiple regression for the task of building the model using observer data collected from ten Radiology residents at Duke University Medical Center for the problem of breast mass diagnosis in mammograms. For each resident, a user-specific model was constructed that predicts the user's expected level of difficulty for each presented case based on two BI-RADS image features. In the experiments, leave-one-out data handling scheme was applied to assign each case to a low-predicted-difficulty or a high-predicted-difficulty group for each resident based on each of the three user models. To evaluate whether the user model is useful in predicting difficulty, the authors performed statistical tests using the generalized estimating equations approach to determine whether the mean actual error is the same or not between the low-predicted-difficulty group and the high-predicted-difficulty group. RESULTS: When the results for all observers were pulled together, the actual errors made by residents were statistically significantly higher for cases in the high-predicted-difficulty group than for cases in the low-predicted-difficulty group for all modeling algorithms (p < or = 0.002 for all methods). This indicates that the user models were able to accurately predict difficulty level of the analyzed cases. Furthermore, the authors determined that among the two BI-RADS features that were used in this study, mass margin was the most useful in predicting individual user errors. CONCLUSIONS: The pilot study shows promise for developing individual user models that can accurately predict the level of difficulty that each case will pose to the radiologist-in-training.

Solving inverse problems with iterative algorithms is popular, especially for large data.

Given an error one is willing to tolerate, an important question is whether it is possible to modify the original iterations to obtain faster convergence to a minimizer achieving the allowed error without increasing the computational cost of each iteration considerably. Relying on recent recovery techniques developed for settings in which the desired signal belongs to some low-dimensional set, we show that using a coarse estimate of this set may lead to faster convergence at the cost of an additional reconstruction error related to the accuracy of the set approximation. Our theory ties to recent advances in sparse recovery, compressed sensing, and deep learning.

It is therefore desirable for both data collectors and users to design procedures that minimize sensitive information leakage.

In this institutional review board-approved study, we analyzed dynamic contrast-enhanced fat-saturated T1-weighted MRI sequences from 131 patients with a core needle biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of DCIS. We explored two different deep learning approaches to predict whether there was an occult invasive component in the analyzed tumors that was ultimately identified at surgical excision. In the first approach, we adopted the transfer learning strategy. Specifically, we used the pre-trained GoogleNet. In the second approach, we used a pre-trained network to extract deep features, and a support vector machine (SVM) that utilizes these features to predict the upstaging of DCIS. We used nested 10-fold cross validation and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to estimate the performance of the predictive models.

Here, we provide a comprehensive follow-up to that work, examining a second representation, pseudo-Zernike polynomials, to determine whether they provide any increase in classification accuracy. We compare the fidelity of both methods using residual root-mean-square (rms) error and evaluate accuracy using several classifiers: neural networks, C4.5 decision trees, Voting Feature Intervals, and Naïve Bayes. We also examine the effect of several meta-learning strategies: boosting, bagging, and Random Forests (RFs).

METHODS: The pre-treatment, one-week post-treatment, and two-month post-treatment T1 and T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI were acquired. 61 radiomic features (intensity histogram-based, morphological, and texture features) were extracted from the gross tumor volume in each image. Delta-radiomics were calculated between the pre-treatment and post-treatment features. Univariate Cox regression and 3 multivariate machine learning methods (L1-regularized logistic regression [L1-LR], random forest [RF] or neural networks [NN]) were used to select a reduced number of features, and 7 machine learning methods (L1-LR, L2-LR, RF, NN, kernel support vector machine [KSVM], linear support vector machine [LSVM], or naïve bayes [NB]) was used to build classification models for predicting OS. The performances of the total 21 model combinations built based on single-time-point radiomics (pre-treatment, one-week post-treatment, and two-month post-treatment) and delta-radiomics were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: For a small cohort of 12 patients, delta-radiomics resulted in significantly higher AUC than pre-treatment radiomics (p-value<0.01). One-week/two-month delta-features resulted in significantly higher AUC (p-value<0.01) than the one-week/two-month post-treatment features, respectively. 18/21 model combinations were with higher AUC from one-week delta-features than two-month delta-features. With one-week delta-features, RF feature selector + KSVM classifier and RF feature selector + NN classifier showed the highest AUC of 0.889.

To be effective, decision fusion requires that the different models provide some degree of complementary information. In this work, we fuse the results of four different machine learning models (Boosted Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Self Organizing Maps) to predict the risk of lung pneumonitis in patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy. Fusion was achieved by simple averaging of the 10-fold cross validated predictions for each patient from all four models. To reduce prediction dependence on the manner in which the data set was split, 10-fold cross-validation was repeated 100 times for random data splitting. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the fused cross-validated results was 0.79, higher than the individual models and with (generally) lower variance. The fusion extracted three important features as the consensus among all four models in predicting radiation pneumonitis risk: chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy, equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD) for exponent a = 1.2 to 3, and female gender.

Method and Materials: The database comprised 111 patients with left‐sided breast treated with radiotherapy (56 diagnosed with cardiac perfusion defects post‐radiotherapy). The four independent models (NNET, SOM, SVM, and MARS) were constructed using a small number of independently selected features. The four models were then fused to a final model by averaging their patient predictions. Patient predictions were generated by testing the models using ten‐fold cross‐validation, wherein 1/10th of the data were tested, in turn, using models built with the remaining 9/10th of the data. To account for the variance in patient predictions caused by the effect of data splitting, 10‐fold cross validation was repeated 100 times with random data splitting. Results: For the fused model, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve for cross‐validated testing was 0.890±0.012 (sensitivity = 80.6±1.7%, specificity = 80.2±1.7%). It was superior to the individual models (NNET: ROC = 0.764±0.015, sensitivity = 72.9±1.5%, specificity = 72.4±1.6%; SOM: ROC = 0.769±0.013, sensitivity = 73.0±1.4%, specificity = 72.2±1.5%; SVM: ROC = 0.900±0.048, sensitivity = 87.3±6.2%, specificity = 86.0±6.1%; MARS: ROC = 0.802±0.009, sensitivity = 76.1±1.1%, specificity = 75.6±1.1%) either in regard to higher predictive capability or lower variance.

In this paper, we prove that at the beginning of an SG-MCMC algorithm, i.e., under limited computational budget/time, a larger minibatch size leads to a faster decrease of the mean squared error bound. The reason for this is due to the prominent noise in small minibatches when calculating stochastic gradients, motivating the necessity of variance reduction in SG-MCMC for practical use. By borrowing ideas from stochastic optimization, we propose a simple and practical variance-reduction technique for SG-MCMC, that is efficient in both computation and storage. More importantly, we develop the theory to prove that our algorithm induces a faster convergence rate than standard SG-MCMC.

Clinical decision support rules based on PE risk-scoring models have been developed to compute pretest probability but are underused and tend to underperform in practice, leading to persistent overuse of CT imaging for PE. Objective: To develop a machine learning model to generate a patient-specific risk score for PE by analyzing longitudinal clinical data as clinical decision support for patients referred for CT imaging for PE. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this diagnostic study, the proposed workflow for the machine learning model, the Pulmonary Embolism Result Forecast Model (PERFORM), transforms raw electronic medical record (EMR) data into temporal feature vectors and develops a decision analytical model targeted toward adult patients referred for CT imaging for PE. The model was tested on holdout patient EMR data from 2 large, academic medical practices. A total of 3397 annotated CT imaging examinations for PE from 3214 unique patients seen at Stanford University hospitals and clinics were used for training and validation. The models were externally validated on 240 unique patients seen at Duke University Medical Center. The comparison with clinical scoring systems was done on randomly selected 100 outpatient samples from Stanford University hospitals and clinics and 101 outpatient samples from Duke University Medical Center. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prediction performance of diagnosing acute PE was evaluated using ElasticNet, artificial neural networks, and other machine learning approaches on holdout data sets from both institutions, and performance of models was measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: Of the 3214 patients included in the study, 1704 (53.0%) were women from Stanford University hospitals and clinics; mean (SD) age was 60.53 (19.43) years. The 240 patients from Duke University Medical Center used for validation included 132 women (55.0%); mean (SD) age was 70.2 (14.2) years. In the samples for clinical scoring system comparisons, the 100 outpatients from Stanford University hospitals and clinics included 67 women (67.0%); mean (SD) age was 57.74 (19.87) years, and the 101 patients from Duke University Medical Center included 59 women (58.4%); mean (SD) age was 73.06 (15.3) years. The best-performing model achieved an AUROC performance of predicting a positive PE study of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87-0.91) on intrainstitutional holdout data with an AUROC of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.69-0.72) on an external data set from Duke University Medical Center; superior AUROC performance and cross-institutional generalization of the model of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.87) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.82), respectively, were noted on holdout outpatient populations from both intrainstitutional and extrainstitutional data. Conclusions and Relevance: The machine learning model, PERFORM, may consider multitudes of applicable patient-specific risk factors and dependencies to arrive at a PE risk prediction that generalizes to new population distributions.

Developing heterogeneous system with hardware accelerator is a promising solution to implement high performance applications where explicitly programmed, rule-based algorithms are either infeasible or inefficient. However, mapping a neural network model to a hardware representation is a complex process, where balancing computation resources and memory accesses is crucial. In this work, we present a systematic approach o optimize the heterogeneous system with a FPGA-based neuromorphic computing accelerator (NCA). For any applications, the neural network topology and computation flow of the accelerator can be configured through a NCA-aware compiler. The FPGA-based NCA contains a generic multi-layer neural network composed of a set of parallel neural processing elements. Such a scheme imitates the human cognition process and follows the hierarchy of neocortex. At architectural level, we decrease the computing resource requirement to enhance computation efficiency. The hardware implementation primarily targets at reducing data communication load: a multi-thread computation engine is utilized to mask the long memory latency. Such a combined solution can well accommodate the ever increasing complexity and scalability of machine learning applications and improve the system performance and efficiency. Through the evaluation across eight representative benchmarks, we observed on average 12.1× speedup and 45.8× energy reduction, with marginal accuracy loss comparing with CPU-only computation.", "publication_location": "Proceedings   Ieee International Symposium on Circuits and Systems", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2016.7527186", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

To exemplify this methodology, structural properties of a biological neural network and randomly wired circuits (RC) were compared. The analyzed biological circuit (BC) represented a sample of 39 neural nuclei which are responsible for the control of the cardiovascular function in higher vertebrates. Initially, direct connections of both circuits were stored in a square matrix format. Then, standard algorithms derived from the theory of directed graphs were applied to analyze the pathways of the circuits according to their length (in number of synapses), degree of connectedness, and structural strength. Thus, the BC was characterized by the presence of short, reciprocal, and unidirectional pathways which presented a high degree of heterogeneity in their strengths. This heterogeneity was mainly due to the existence of a small cluster of reciprocally connected neural nuclei in the circuit that have access, through short pathways, to most of the network. On the other hand, RCs were characterized by the presence of long and mainly reciprocal pathways which showed lower and absolute homogeneous strengths.

This ability requires a neural code that represents probability distributions and neural circuits that are capable of implementing the operations of probabilistic inference. The proposed probabilistic population coding (PPC) framework provides a statistically efficient neural representation of probability distributions that is both broadly consistent with physiological measurements and capable of implementing some of the basic operations of probabilistic inference in a biologically plausible way. However, these experiments and the corresponding neural models have largely focused on simple (tractable) probabilistic computations such as cue combination, coordinate transformations, and decision making. As a result it remains unclear how to generalize this framework to more complex probabilistic computations. Here we address this short coming by showing that a very general approximate inference algorithm known as Variational Bayesian Expectation Maximization can be naturally implemented within the linear PPC framework. We apply this approach to a generic problem faced by any given layer of cortex, namely the identification of latent causes of complex mixtures of spikes. We identify a formal equivalent between this spike pattern demixing problem and topic models used for document classification, in particular Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We then construct a neural network implementation of variational inference and learning for LDA that utilizes a linear PPC. This network relies critically on two non-linear operations: divisive normalization and super-linear facilitation, both of which are ubiquitously observed in neural circuits. We also demonstrate how online learning can be achieved using a variation of Hebb's rule and describe an extension of this work which allows us to deal with time varying and correlated latent causes.", "publication_location": "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems", "link": null, "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

This is an important problem in neuroscience research, as such estimates may provide insights into systems-level function of these structures. Since single-unit neural data tends to be unevenly sampled and highly variable under similar behavioral conditions, obtaining such estimates is a difficult task. In particular, a class of cells in the superior colliculus called buildup neurons can have very narrow regions of saccade vectors for which they discharge at high rates but very large surround regions over which they discharge at low, but not zero, levels. Estimating the dynamic movement fields for these cells for two spatial dimensions at closely spaced timed intervals is a difficult problem, and no general method has been described that can be applied to all buildup cells. Estimation of individual collicular cells' spatiotemporal movement fields is a prerequisite for obtaining reliable two-dimensional estimates of the population activity on the collicular motor map during saccades. Therefore, we have developed several computational-geometry-based algorithms that regularize the data before computing a surface estimation using RBF networks. The method is then expanded to the problem of estimating simultaneous spatiotemporal activity occurring across the superior colliculus during a single movement (the inverse problem). In principle, this methodology could be applied to any neural structure with a regular, two-dimensional organization, provided a sufficient spatial distribution of sampled neurons is available.", "publication_location": "Journal of Computational Neuroscience", "link": null, "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The study site is the Venice lagoon, and the material available is a spectrally sampled Compact Airborne Spectral Imager (CASI) image, in conjunction with ground truth for precise characterization of vegetation communities. Detailed observations of vegetation species and of their fractional abundance were collected for 36 Regions Of Interest (ROI): such field polygons are used for classification training and accuracy assessment. To select the most significant spectral channels, the Spectral Reconstruction method was applied to the image data: a set of 6 bands was selected as optimal for classification, out of the 15 available. The spatial heterogeneity of salt-marsh vegetation is significant and even at the spatial resolution of the airborne CASI image data, mixed pixels are observed. The Vegetation Community based Neural Network Classifier (VCNNC) is introduced to cope with a situation where no pure pixels exist, and was applied to the set of 6 selected bands. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons of classification results of VCNNC with those of conventional Neural Network Classifier (NNC), trained and assessed on exactly the same data sets, shows that VCNNC's accuracy is substantially higher (≈ 91%) than that of NNC (≈ 84%), while the Kappa coefficient is 0.87 for VCNNC and 0.75 for the NNC method. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

By combining optogenetics with microelectrode array recording, we show that these randomly organized cortical microcircuits are able to process complex spatiotemporal information, allowing the identification of a large number of temporal sequences and classification of musical styles. These experiments uncovered spatiotemporal memory processes lasting several seconds. Neural network simulations indicated that both short-term synaptic plasticity and recurrent connections are required for the emergence of this capability. Interestingly, NMDA receptor function is not a requisite for these short-term spatiotemporal memory processes. Indeed, blocking the NMDA receptor with the antagonist APV significantly improved the temporal processing ability of the networks, by reducing spontaneously occurring network bursts.

Despite numerous studies carried out using MEAs, many functional, chemical and structural mechanisms of how dissociated cortical neurons develop and respond to external stimuli are not yet well understood because of the lack of quantitative studies that assess how their development can be affected by chronic external stimulation. METHODS: To investigate network changes, we analyzed a large MEA data set composed of neuron spikes recorded from cultures of dissociated rat cortical neurons plated on MEA dishes with 59 recording electrodes each. Neural network activity was recorded during the first five weeks of each culture's in-vitro development. Stimulation sessions were delivered to each of the 59 electrodes. The False Discovery Rate technique was used to quantify the temporal evolution of dissociated cortical neurons. Our analysis focused on network responses that occurred within selected time window durations, namely 50 ms, 100 ms and 150 ms after stimulus onset. RESULTS: Our results show an evolution in dissociated cortical neuronal network activity over time, that reflects the network synaptic evolution. Furthermore, we tested the sensitivity of our technique to different observation time windows and found that varying the time windows, allows us to capture different dynamics of the observed responses. In addition, when selecting a 150 ms observation time window, our findings indicate that cultures dissociated from the same brain tissue display trends in their temporal evolution that are more similar than those obtained from different brains. CONCLUSION: Our results emphasize that the FDR technique can be implemented without the need to make any particular assumptions about the data a priori. The proposed technique was able to capture the well-known dissociated cortical neuron networks' temporal evolution, that has been previously observed in in-vivo and in intact brain tissue studies. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the time window that is used to capture the stimulus-evoked network responses is a critical parameter to analyze the electrical behavioral and temporal evolution of dissociated cortical neurons.", "publication_location": "Bmc Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2202-15-17", "citations": "8", "readership": "65", "tweets": "4", "news_mentions": " "},

At the neural level, these models propose that each region along the visual processing hierarchy entails one set of processing units encoding predictions of bottom-up input, and another set computing mismatches (prediction error or surprise) between predictions and evidence. This contrasts with traditional views of visual neurons operating purely as bottom-up feature detectors. In support of the predictive coding hypothesis, a recent human neuroimaging study (Egner, Monti, & Summerfield, 2010) showed that neural population responses to expected and unexpected face and house stimuli in the \"fusiform face area\" (FFA) could be well-described as a summation of hypothetical face-expectation and -surprise signals, but not by feature detector responses. Here, we used computer simulations to test whether these imaging data could be formally explained within the broader framework of a mathematical neural network model of associative learning (Schmajuk, Gray, & Lam, 1996). Results show that FFA responses could be fit very closely by model variables coding for conditional predictions (and their violations) of stimuli that unconditionally activate the FFA.

HIGHLIGHTS • We suggest classifying variability of neuronal responses as follows: false (associated with a lack of knowledge about the influential factors), \"genuine harmful\" (noise), \"genuine neutral\" (synonyms, repeats), and \"genuine useful\" (the basis of neuroplasticity and learning). • The genuine neutral variability is considered in terms of the phenomenon of degeneracy. • Of particular importance is the genuine useful variability that is considered as a potential basis for neuroplasticity and learning. This type of variability is considered in terms of the neural Darwinism theory. In many cases, neural signals detected under the same external experimental conditions significantly change from trial to trial. The variability phenomenon, which complicates extraction of reproducible results and is ignored in many studies by averaging, has attracted attention of researchers in recent years. In this paper, we classify possible types of variability based on its functional significance and describe features of each type. We describe the key adaptive significance of variability at the neural network level and the degeneracy phenomenon that may be important for learning processes in connection with the principle of neuronal group selection.", "publication_location": "Frontiers in Human Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00603", "citations": "2", "readership": "30", "tweets": "17", "news_mentions": " "},

Saving ingroup members, who seem warm and competent (e.g. Americans), was most morally acceptable in the context of a dilemma where one person was killed to save five people. Extreme outgroup members, who seem neither warm nor competent (e.g. homeless), were the worst off; it was most morally acceptable to sacrifice them and least acceptable to save them. Sacrificing these low-warmth, low-competence targets to save ingroup targets, specifically, activated a neural network associated with resolving complex tradeoffs: medial PFC (BA 9, extending caudally to include ACC), left lateral OFC (BA 47) and left dorsolateral PFC (BA 10). These brain regions were recruited for dilemmas that participants ultimately rated as relatively more acceptable. We propose that participants, though ambivalent, overrode general aversion to these tradeoffs when the cost of sacrificing a low-warmth, low-competence target was pitted against the benefit of saving ingroup targets.

Peripheral innervation is involved in patterning development of many organs but has been given little attention in gonad development. In this study, we show that while innervation in the male reproductive complex is restricted to the epididymis and vas deferens and never invades the interior of the testis, neural crest-derived innervation invades the interior of the ovary around E16.5. Individual neural crest cells colonize the ovary, differentiate into neurons and glia, and form a dense neural network within the ovarian medulla. Using a sex-reversing mutant mouse line, we show that innervation is specific to ovary development, is not dependent on the genetic sex of gonadal or neural crest cells, and may be blocked by repressive guidance signals elevated in the male pathway.

Each face was presented along with a voice simulating the individual speaking their name and a biographical fact. Following this learning procedure, the associated verbal information could be recalled accurately in response to each face. These learned faces were subsequently viewed together with new faces in a memory task. Subjects made a yes-no recognition decision in response to each face while also covertly retrieving the person-specific information associated with each learned face. Brain activity that accompanied this retrieval of person-specific information was contrasted to that when new faces were processed. Functional magnetic resonance imaging in 10 participants showed that several brain regions were activated during blocks of learned faces, including left hippocampus, left middle temporal gyrus, left insula, and bilateral cerebellum. Recordings of event-related brain potentials in 10 other participants tracked the time course of face processing and showed that learned faces engaged neural activity responsible for person recognition 300-600 msec after face onset.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) recently demonstrated a great opportunity toward unsupervised learning with the intention to mitigate the massive human efforts on data labeling in supervised learning algorithms. GAN combines a generative model and a discriminative model to oppose each other in an adversarial situation to refine their abilities. Existing nonvolatile memory based machine learning accelerators, however, could not support the computational needs required by GAN training. Specifically, the generator utilizes a new operator, called transposed convolution, which introduces significant resource underutilization when executed on conventional neural network accelerators as it inserts massive zeros in its input before a convolution operation. In this work, we propose a novel computational deformation technique that synergistically optimizes the forward and backward functions in transposed convolution to eliminate the large resource underutilization. In addition, we present dedicated control units - a dataflow mapper and an operation scheduler, to support the proposed execution model with high parallelism and low energy consumption. ZARA is implemented with commodity ReRAM chips, and experimental results show that our design can improve GAN's training performance by averagely 1.6×∼23× over CMOS-based GAN accelerators.

We apply Markov branching process theory to derive an equation governing the average avalanche shape for cascade dynamics on networks. Analysis of the equation at criticality demonstrates that nonsymmetric average avalanche shapes (as observed in some experiments) occur for certain combinations of dynamics and network topology.

Although ANNs exhibit excellent performance and generalization abilities when trained in batch mode, when they are trained incrementally with new data they tend to forget previous information due to a phenomenon known as interference. McCloskey and Cohen [1] were the first to suggest that a fundamental limitation of ANNsis that the process of learning a newset of patternsmaysuddenly and completely erase a network's knowledge of what it had already learned. This phenomenon, known as catastrophic interference or catastrophic forgetting, seriously limits the applicability of ANNs to adaptive feedback control, and incremental function approximation. Natural cognitive systems learn most tasks incrementally and need not relearn prior patterns to retain them in their long-term memory (LTM) during their lifetime. Catastrophic interference in ANNs is caused by their very ability to generalize using a single set of shared connection weights, and a set of interconnected nonlinear basis functions. Therefore, the modular and sparse architectures that have been proposed so far for suppressing interference also limit a neural network's ability to approximate and generalize highly nonlinear functions.

Methods: Mammograms were obtained from 206 patients who obtained breast biopsies. Mammographic findings were recorded by radiologists for each patient. In addition, the outcome of the biopsy was recorded. Of the 206 cases, 73 were malignant while 133 were benign at the time of biopsy. A genetic algorithm (GA) was developed to adjust the weights of an artificial neural network (ANN) so that the ANN would output the outcome of the biopsy when the mammographic findings were given as inputs. The GA is a technique for function optimization that reflects biological genetic evolution. The ANN was a fully connected feed-forward network using a sigmoid activation with 11 inputs, one hidden layer with 10 nodes, and one output node (benign/malignant). The GA approach allows much flexibility in selecting the function to be optimized. In this work both mean-squared error (MSE) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve area (Az) were explored as optimization criteria. The system was trained using a bootstrap sampling. Results: Optimizing for the two criteria result in different solutions. The \"best\" solution was obtained by minimizing a linear combination of MSE and (1-Az). ROC areas were 0.82 +/- 0.07, somewhat less than those obtained using backpropagation for ANN training: 0.90 +/- 0.05.

Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. The purpose of this study was to develop a robust, automated multi-organ segmentation model for clinical adult and pediatric CT and implement the model as part of a patient-specific safety and quality monitoring system. 3D convolutional neural network (Unet) models were setup to segment 30 different organs and structures at the diagnostic image resolution. For each organ, 200 manually-labeled cases were used to train the network, fitting it to different clinical imaging resolutions and contrast enhancement stages. The dataset was randomly shuffled, and divided with 6/2/2 train/validation/test set split. The model was deployed to automatically segment 1200 clinical CT images as a demonstration of the utility of the method. Each case was made into a patient-specific phantom based on the segmentation masks, with unsegmented organs and structures filled in by deforming a template XCAT phantom of similar anatomy. The organ doses were then estimated using a validated scanner-specific MC-GPU package using the actual scan information. The segmented organ information was likewise used to assess contrast, noise, and detectability index within each organ. The neural network segmentation model showed dice similarity coefficients (DSC) above 0.85 for the majority of organs. Notably, the lungs and liver showed a DSC of 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. The segmentation results produced patient-specific dose and quality values across the tested 1200 patients with representative the histogram distributions.

A modern neuromorphic acceleration system could consist of hundreds of accelerators, which are often organized through a network-on-chip (NoC). Although the overall computing ability is greatly promoted by a large number of the accelerators, the power consumption and average delay of the NoC itself becomes prominent. In this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of the data traffic in neuromorphic acceleration systems and the bottleneck of the popular NoC designs adopted in such systems. We then propose Neu-NoC - a high-efficient interconnection network to reduce the redundant data traffic in neuromorphic acceleration systems and explore the data transfer ability between adjacent layers. A sophisticated neural network aware mapping algorithm and a multicast transmission scheme are designed to alleviate data traffic congestions without increasing the average transmission distance. Finally, we explore the sparsity characteristics of fully-connected NNs. Simulation results show that compared to the most widely-used Mesh NoC design, Neu-NoC can substantially reduce the average data latency by 28.5% and the energy consumption by 39.2% in accelerated neuromorphic systems.", "publication_location": "Proceedings of the Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference, Asp Dac", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2018.8297296", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The pick-up of three character parameters is handled by computer image processing. Only one output parameter is apple rating, which is fall into three grades: A, B and C. Regarding three character parameters as input, we obtain the apple grade based on fuzzy arithmetic. Finally, we set forth the archetypal non-destructive selection system, which includes robot, AGV, conveyor, sensors and etc. Results of experiments show that this method can distinguish the apple's quality as well as we set before the experiments, and the non-destructive system is feasible. © (2009) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.", "publication_location": "Advanced Materials Research", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.69-70.705", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Over the last 20 years, more and more manufacturing operations have embraced machine vision systems to increase productivity, reliability and cost-effectiveness, including reducing the number of human operators required. Although machine vision technology has long been capable of solving simple problems, it has still not been broadly implemented. The reason is that until now, no machine vision system has been designed to meet the unique demands of complicated pattern recognition. The ZiCAM™ family was specifically developed to be the first practical hardware to meet these needs. To be able to address non-traditional applications, the machine vision industry must include smart camera technology that meets its users' demands for lower costs, better performance and the ability to address applications of irregular lighting, patterns and color. The next-generation smart cameras will need to evolve as a fundamentally different kind of sensor, with new technology that behaves like a human but performs like a computer. Neural network based systems, coupled with self-taught, n-space, non-linear modeling, promises to be the enabler of that next generation of machine vision equipment. Image processing technology is now available that enables a system to match an operator's subjectivity. A Zero-Instruction-Set- Computer (ZISC) powered smart camera allows high-speed fuzzy-logic processing, without the need for computer programming. This can address applications of validating highly variable and pseudo-random patterns. A hardware-based implementation of a neural network, Zero-Instruction-SetComputer, enables a vision system to \"think\" and \"inspect\" like a human, with the speed and reliability of a machine.", "publication_location": "Smart Structures and Materials 2005: Active Materials: Behavior and Mechanics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.527149", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Reliability assessment is achieved by measuring the accuracy of a CAD system with known cases similar to the one in question. The proposed technique analyzes the feature space neighborhood of the query case to dynamically select an input-dependent set of known cases relevant to the query. This set is used to assess the local (query-specific) accuracy of the CAD system. The estimated local accuracy is utilized as a reliability measure of the CAD response to the query case. The underlying hypothesis of the study is that CAD decisions with higher reliability are more accurate. The above hypothesis was tested using a mammographic database of 1337 regions of interest (ROIs) with biopsy-proven ground truth (681 with masses, 656 with normal parenchyma). Three types of decision models, (i) a back-propagation neural network (BPNN), (ii) a generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and (iii) a support vector machine (SVM), were developed to detect masses based on eight morphological features automatically extracted from each ROI. The performance of all decision models was evaluated using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The study showed that the proposed reliability measure is a strong predictor of the CAD system's case-specific accuracy. Specifically, the ROC area index for CAD predictions with high reliability was significantly better than for those with low reliability values. This result was consistent across all decision models investigated in the study. The proposed case-specific reliability analysis technique could be used to alert the CAD user when an opinion that is unlikely to be reliable is offered. The technique can be easily deployed in the clinical environment because it is applicable with a wide range of classifiers regardless of their structure and it requires neither additional training nor building multiple decision models to assess the case-specific CAD accuracy.", "publication_location": "Medical Physics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1118/1.2432409", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

A new neural network technology was developed to improve the diagnosis of breast cancer using mammogram findings. The paradigm, adaptive boosting (AB), uses a markedly different theory in solving the computational intelligence (CI) problem. AB, a new machine learning paradigm, focuses on finding weak learning algorithm(s) that initially need to provide slightly better than \"random\" performance (i.e., approximately 55%) when processing a mammogram training set. By successive development of additional architectures (using the mammogram training set), the adaptive boosting process improves performance of the basic evolutionary programming derived neural network architectures. The results of these several EP-derived hybrid architectures are then intelligently combined and tested using a similar validation mammogram data set. Optimization, focused on improving specificity and positive predictive value at very high sensitivities, with an analysis of the performance of the hybrid would be most meaningful. Using the DUKE mammogram database of 500 biopsy proven samples, this hybrid, on average, was able to achieve (under statistical 5-fold cross-validation) a specificity of 48.3% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 51.8% while maintaining 100% sensitivity.

An observer study by use of receiver operating characteristics analysis was first conducted with five radiologists to demonstrate that presenting similar images for malignant nodules and benign nodules can significantly improve radiologists' performance in the diagnosis of unknown nodules. Another observer study was then conducted for obtaining reliable data on subjective similarity ratings by 10 radiologists. Based on the subjective similarity ratings, three important features were selected from a number of nodule features, and four different techniques for the determination of similarity measures, namely, a feature-based technique, a pixel-value-difference based technique, a cross-correlation-based technique, and a neural-network-based technique, were investigated and evaluated in terms of the correlation coefficient with the subjective similarity ratings.

The physical constrains when implementing a neural network with memristor crossbar array have also been discussed. Our results show that the BSB circuit has a high tolerance to random noise. Comparably, the correlations between memristor arrays introduces directional noise and hence dominates the quality of circuits. © 2012 ACM.", "publication_location": "Proceedings   Design Automation Conference", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2228360.2228448", "citations": "113", "readership": "66", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Detecting an anomaly such as a malignant tumor or a nodule from medical images including mammogram, CT or PET images is still an ongoing research problem drawing a lot of attention with applications in medical diagnosis. A conventional way to address this is to learn a discriminative model using training datasets of negative and positive samples. The learned model can be used to classify a testing sample into a positive or negative class. However, in medical applications, the high unbalance between negative and positive samples poses a difficulty for learning algorithms, as they will be biased towards the majority group, i.e., the negative one. To address this imbalanced data issue as well as leverage the huge amount of negative samples, i.e., normal medical images, we propose to learn an unsupervised model to characterize the negative class. To make the learned model more flexible and extendable for medical images of different scales, we have designed an autoencoder based on a deep neural network to characterize the negative patches decomposed from large medical images. A testing image is decomposed into patches and then fed into the learned autoencoder to reconstruct these patches themselves. The reconstruction error of one patch is used to classify this patch into a binary class, i.e., a positive or a negative one, leading to a one-class classifier. The positive patches highlight the suspicious areas containing anomalies in a large medical image. The proposed method has been tested on InBreast dataset and achieves an AUC of 0.84. The main contribution of our work can be summarized as follows. 1) The proposed one-class learning requires only data from one class, i.e., the negative data; 2) The patch-based learning makes the proposed method scalable to images of different sizes and helps avoid the large scale problem for medical images; 3) The training of the proposed deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) based auto-encoder is fast and stable.", "publication_location": "Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging   Proceedings of Spie", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2293408", "citations": "9", "readership": "27", "tweets": "3", "news_mentions": " "},

One finding is that the intensity discrepancy between digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) of 3D-CT and measured x-ray projection has an impact on the performance. To address the issue, a patient-dependent intensity matching process for 3D-CT was performed using 3D-CBCT from the same patient, which was sometimes inefficient and may adversely affect the clinical implementation of the framework. To circumvent this, in this work, we propose and validate a patient-independent intensity matching method based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN). METHODS: A 3D cGAN was trained to approximate the mapping from 3D-CT to 3D-CBCT from previous patient data. By applying the trained network to new patient, synthetic 3D-CBCT could be generated without the need to perform actual CBCT scan on that patient. The DRR of synthetic 3D-CBCT was subsequently utilized in our CNN-based tumor localization scheme. The method was tested on 12 patient data with same imaging parameters. The resulting 3D-CBCT and DRR were compared with real ones to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The tumor localization errors were also analyzed. RESULTS: The difference between the synthetic and real 3D-CBCT had median value no more than 10 HU for all patients. The relative error between DRR and measured x-ray projection was less than 4.8%±2.0% for all patients. For the three patients with visible tumor in x-ray projections, the average tumor localization errors were below 1.7 mm and 0.9 mm in the superior-inferior (SI) and lateral directions. CONCLUSION: A patient-independent CT intensity matching method was developed, based on which accurate tumor localization can be achieved. It does not require actual CBCT scan to be performed before treatment for each patient, therefore making it more efficient in the clinical workflow.", "publication_location": "Phys Med Biol", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ab8bf2", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

All rights reserved. Spike sorting is a critical first step in extracting neural signals from large-scale electrophysiological data. This manuscript describes an efficient, reliable pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), where neural signals appear across many electrodes and spike sorting currently represents a major computational bottleneck. We present several new techniques that make dense MEA spike sorting more robust and scalable. Our pipeline is based on an efficient multistage \"triage-then-cluster-then-pursuit\" approach that initially extracts only clean, high-quality waveforms from the electrophysiological time series by temporarily skipping noisy or \"collided\" events (representing two neurons firing synchronously). This is accomplished by developing a neural network detection method followed by efficient outlier triaging. The clean waveforms are then used to infer the set of neural spike waveform templates through nonparametric Bayesian clustering. Our clustering approach adapts a \"coreset\" approach for data reduction and uses efficient inference methods in a Dirichlet process mixture model framework to dramatically improve the scalability and reliability of the entire pipeline. The \"triaged\" waveforms are then finally recovered with matching-pursuit deconvolution techniques. The proposed methods improve on the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and stability on both real and biophysically-realistic simulated MEA data. Furthermore, the proposed pipeline is efficient, learning templates and clustering faster than real-time for a ≈ 500-electrode dataset, largely on a single CPU core.", "publication_location": "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems", "link": null, "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The significant linear decrement occurred for the novel but not the familiar images, and behavioral measures ruled out a corresponding decline in vigilance. Additionally, early in the series, the hippocampus was inversely coupled with the dorsal striatum, lateral and medial prefrontal cortex, and posterior visual processing regions; this inverse coupling also habituated as novelty accumulated.

Recordings from multichannel electrodes placed in subcortical and cortical regions of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical (BGTC) motor network during DBS surgical procedures can provide rich physiologic information from accessible network nodes. However, most investigations focus on presumed spatio-spectral points of interest, neither fully utilizing the richness of spatial, spectral and temporal aspects of the multivariate signals nor making discoveries in the context of all possible candidates. In addition, aggregated network-level information has been missed out. APPROACH:We use complex network analysis to characterize functional network characteristics of the pallidocortical subcircuit of the BGTC motor network in PD at rest and with movement. The network matrix was constructed using distinct frequency bands at each anatomic recording site as virtual nodes and spectral connectivity (through phase-amplitude coupling and coherence) as network edges. MAIN RESULTS:We confirm the critical roles of beta bands and provide additional evidence on their differential functional roles in the pallidocortical motor network. Moreover, significant changes (p   <  0.05) in network functional segregation and integration between rest and movement conditions are revealed for the first time. More importantly, movement-dependent modulation of these network metrics are significantly correlated with hemibody unified PD rating scales (UPDRS), providing network-level perspectives of the pallidocortical motor network pertaining to PD symptoms (p   <  0.05). SIGNIFICANCE:Findings in the present study provide network-level understanding of neuronal mechanisms in the pallidocortical motor network underlying PD. It is also highly plausible that the demonstrated approach can be applied in other important subcircuits towards a comprehensive understanding of the BGTC motor network.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neural Engineering", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/ab4341", "citations": "1", "readership": "6", "tweets": "4", "news_mentions": " "},

The cardiac neural crest cells are a subpopulation of cranial neural crest discovered nearly 30 years ago by ablation of premigratory neural crest. The cardiac neural crest cells are necessary for normal cardiovascular development. We begin with a description of the crest cells in normal development, including their function in remodeling the pharyngeal arch arteries, outflow tract septation, valvulogenesis, and development of the cardiac conduction system. The cells are also responsible for modulating signaling in the caudal pharynx, including the second heart field. Many of the molecular pathways that are known to influence specification, migration, patterning and final targeting of the cardiac neural crest cells are reviewed. The cardiac neural crest cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of various human cardiocraniofacial syndromes such as DiGeorge, Velocardiofacial, CHARGE, Fetal Alcohol, Alagille, LEOPARD, and Noonan syndromes, as well as Retinoic Acid Embryopathy. The loss of neural crest cells or their dysfunction may not always directly cause abnormal cardiovascular development, but are involved secondarily because crest cells represent a major component in the complex tissue interactions in the head, pharynx and outflow tract. Thus many of the human syndromes linking defects in the heart, face and brain can be better understood when considered within the context of a single cardiocraniofacial developmental module with the neural crest being a key cell type that interconnects the regions.", "publication_location": "Differentiation; Research in Biological Diversity", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diff.2012.04.005", "citations": "135", "readership": "177", "tweets": "1", "news_mentions": " "},

The question we address here is: how could neural circuits implement such marginalizations? We show that when spike trains exhibit a particular type of statistics--associated with constant Fano factors and gain-invariant tuning curves, as is often reported in vivo--some of the more common marginalizations can be achieved with networks that implement a quadratic nonlinearity and divisive normalization, the latter being a type of nonlinear lateral inhibition that has been widely reported in neural circuits.

Cognitive neuroscience has largely focused on voluntary memory, leaving the neural mechanisms of involuntary memory largely unknown. We hypothesized that, because the main difference between voluntary and involuntary memory is the controlled retrieval processes required by the former, there would be greater frontal activity for voluntary than involuntary memories. Conversely, we predicted that other components of the episodic retrieval network would be similarly engaged in the two types of memory. During encoding, all participants heard sounds, half paired with pictures of complex scenes and half presented alone. During retrieval, paired and unpaired sounds were presented, panned to the left or to the right. Participants in the involuntary group were instructed to indicate the spatial location of the sound, whereas participants in the voluntary group were asked to additionally recall the pictures that had been paired with the sounds. All participants reported the incidence of their memories in a postscan session. Consistent with our predictions, voluntary memories elicited greater activity in dorsal frontal regions than involuntary memories, whereas other components of the retrieval network, including medial-temporal, ventral occipitotemporal, and ventral parietal regions were similarly engaged by both types of memories.

This frontoparietal control network has also been found to be activated when attention is oriented to nonspatial stimulus features (e.g., motion). To test the generality of the frontoparietal network in attentional control, we directly compared spatial and nonspatial attention in a cuing paradigm. Event-related fMRI methods permitted the isolation of attentional control activity during orienting to a location or to a nonspatial stimulus feature (color).

It is therefore meaningful to conduct similar experiments on biological neuronal networks to validate these results. Studies of learning and memory in dissociated rodent neuronal cultures remain inconclusive to date. Synchronized network bursts (SNBs) that occur spontaneously and periodically have been speculated to be an intervening factor.

The precise impact of miRNAs on presynaptic function and neurotransmission remains, however, poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we identify miR-27b-an abundant neuronal miRNA implicated in neurological disorders-as a global regulator of the presynaptic transcriptome. miR-27b influences the expression of three quarters of genes associated with presynaptic function in cortical neurons. Contrary to expectation, a large majority of these genes are up-regulated by miR-27b. This stimulatory effect is mediated by miR-27b-directed silencing of several transcriptional repressors that cooperate to suppress the presynaptic transcriptome. The strongest repressive activity appears to be mediated by Bmi1, a component of the polycomb repressive complex implicated in self-renewal of neural stem cells. miR-27b knockdown leads to reduced synaptogenesis and to a marked decrease in neural network activity, which is fully restored by RNAi-mediated silencing of Bmi1. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that silencing of Bmi1 by miR-27b relieves repression of the presynaptic transcriptome and supports neurotransmission in cortical networks. These results expand the repressive activity of Bmi1 to genes involved in synaptic function and identify a unique post-transcriptional circuitry that stimulates expression of synaptic genes and promotes synapse differentiation.", "publication_location": "Bmc Genomics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-016-3139-7", "citations": "7", "readership": "21", "tweets": "3", "news_mentions": " "},

PTSD may lead to enhanced processing of trauma-related material, or it may cause impaired processing of trauma-unrelated information. However, other forms of emotional information may also alter cognition in PTSD. In this review, we discuss the behavioral and neural effects of emotion processing on cognition in PTSD, with a focus on neuroimaging results. We propose a model of emotion-cognition interaction based on evidence of two network models of altered brain activation in PTSD. The first is a trauma-disrupted network made up of ventrolateral PFC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hippocampus, insula, and dorsomedial PFC that are differentially modulated by trauma content relative to emotional trauma-unrelated information. The trauma-disrupted network forms a subnetwork of regions within a larger, widely recognized network organized into ventral and dorsal streams for processing emotional and cognitive information that converge in the medial PFC and cingulate cortex. Models of fear learning, while not a cognitive process in the conventional sense, provide important insights into the maintenance of the core symptom clusters of PTSD such as re-experiencing and hypervigilance. Fear processing takes place within the limbic corticostriatal loop composed of threat-alerting and threat-assessing components. Understanding the disruptions in these two networks, and their effect on individuals with PTSD, will lead to an improved knowledge of the etiopathogenesis of PTSD and potential targets for both psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic interventions.", "publication_location": "Frontiers in Psychology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00449", "citations": "36", "readership": "90", "tweets": "2", "news_mentions": " "},

Before scanning, participants completed a laboratory memory encoding task in which they studied four-word \"chains\" spread across three word pairs. During scanning, participants completed a laboratory memory retrieval task, in which they recalled the word chains, and an autobiographical memory retrieval task, in which they recalled specific personal events associated with word cues. Importantly, response times were similar in the two tasks, allowing for a direct comparison of the activation time courses. We found that during memory search (searching for the memory target), similar brain regions were activated during both the autobiographical and laboratory tasks, whereas during memory recovery (accessing the memory traces; i.e., ecphory), clear differences emerged: regions of the default mode network (DMN) were activated greater during autobiographical than laboratory memory, whereas the bilateral superior parietal lobules were activated greater during laboratory than autobiographical memory. Also, multivariate functional connectivity analyses revealed that regardless of memory stage, the DMN and ventral attention network exhibited a more integrated topology in the functional network underlying autobiographical (vs. laboratory) memory retrieval, whereas the fronto-parietal task control network exhibited a more integrated topology in the functional network underlying laboratory (vs. autobiographical) memory retrieval.

Abnormalities in brain rhythms have been linked to numerous disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. Rhythmic electrical stimulation (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial alternating current stimulation) has been used to modulate these oscillations and produce lasting changes in neural activity. In this computational study, we investigate the combined effects of sinusoidal stimulation and synaptic plasticity on model networks comprised of simple, tunable four-neuron oscillators. While not intended to model a specific brain circuit, this idealization was created to provide some intuition on how electrical modulation can induce plastic changes in the oscillatory state. Linked pairs of oscillators were stimulated with sinusoidal current, and their behavior was measured as a function of their intrinsic frequencies, inter-oscillator synaptic strengths, and stimulus strength and frequency. Under certain stimulus conditions, sinusoidal current can disrupt the network's natural firing patterns. Synaptic plasticity can induce weight imbalances that permanently change the characteristic firing behavior of the network. Grids of 100 oscillators with random frequencies were also subjected to a wide array of stimulus conditions. The characteristics of the post-stimulus network activity depend heavily on the stimulus frequency and amplitude as well as the initial strength of inter-oscillator connections. Synchronization arises at the network level from complex patterns of activity propagation, which are enhanced or disrupted by different stimuli.

Following technology scaling, on-chip heterogeneous architecture emerges as a promising solution to combat the power wall of microprocessors. This work presents Harmonica - aframework of heterogeneous computing system enhanced by memristor-based neuromorphic computing accelerators (NCAs). In Harmonica, a conventional pipeline is augmented with a NCA which is designed to speedup artificial neural network (ANN) relevant executions by leveraging the extremely efficient mixed-signal computation capability of nanoscale memristor-based crossbar (MBC) arrays. With the help of a mixed-signal interconnection network (M-Net), the hierarchically arranged MBC arrays can accelerate the computation of a variety of ANNs. Moreover, an inline calibration scheme is proposed to ensure the computation accuracy degradation incurred by the memristor resistance shifting within an acceptable range during NCA executions. Compared to general-purpose processor, Harmonica can achieve on average 27.06 × performance speedup and 25.23 × energy savings when the NCA is configured with auto-associative memory (AAM) implementation. If the NCA is configured with multilayer perception (MLP) implementation, the performance speedup and energy savings can be boosted to 178.41 × and 184.24 ×, respectively, with slightly degraded computation accuracy. Moreover, the performance and power efficiency of Harmonica are superior to the designs with either digital neural processing units (D-NPUs) or MBC arrays cooperating with a digital interconnection network.

{"title": "Deep learning based spectral extrapolation for dual-source, dual-energy x-ray computed tomography.", "authors": "Clark, DP; Schwartz, FR; Marin, D; Ramirez-Giraldo, JC; Badea, CT", "published_date": "June 12, 2020", "doi": "10.1002/mp.14324", "abstract": "PURPOSE: Data completion is commonly employed in dual-source, dual-energy computed tomography (CT) when physical or hardware constraints limit the field of view (FoV) covered by one of two imaging chains. Practically, dual-energy data completion is accomplished by estimating missing projection data based on the imaging chain with the full FoV and then by appropriately truncating the analytical reconstruction of the data with the smaller FoV. While this approach works well in many clinical applications, there are applications which would benefit from spectral contrast estimates over the larger FoV (spectral extrapolation)-e.g. model-based iterative reconstruction, contrast-enhanced abdominal imaging of large patients, interior tomography, and combined temporal and spectral imaging. METHODS: To document the fidelity of spectral extrapolation and to prototype a deep learning algorithm to perform it, we assembled a data set of 50 dual-source, dual-energy abdominal x-ray CT scans (acquired at Duke University Medical Center with 5 Siemens Flash scanners; chain A: 50 cm FoV, 100 kV; chain B: 33 cm FoV, 140 kV + Sn; helical pitch: 0.8). Data sets were reconstructed using ReconCT (v14.1, Siemens Healthineers): 768 × 768 pixels per slice, 50 cm FoV, 0.75 mm slice thickness, \"Dual-Energy - WFBP\" reconstruction mode with dual-source data completion. A hybrid architecture consisting of a learned piecewise linear transfer function (PLTF) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained using 40 scans (five scans reserved for validation, five for testing). The PLTF learned to map chain A spectral contrast to chain B spectral contrast voxel-wise, performing an image domain analog of dual-source data completion with approximate spectral reweighting. The CNN with its U-net structure then learned to improve the accuracy of chain B contrast estimates by copying chain A structural information, by encoding prior chain A, chain B contrast relationships, and by generalizing feature-contrast associations. Training was supervised, using data from within the 33-cm chain B FoV to optimize and assess network performance. RESULTS: Extrapolation performance on the testing data confirmed our network's robustness and ability to generalize to unseen data from different patients, yielding maximum extrapolation errors of 26 HU following the PLTF and 7.5 HU following the CNN (averaged per target organ). Degradation of network performance when applied to a geometrically simple phantom confirmed our method's reliance on feature-contrast relationships in correctly inferring spectral contrast. Integrating our image domain spectral extrapolation network into a standard dual-source, dual-energy processing pipeline for Siemens Flash scanner data yielded spectral CT data with adequate fidelity for the generation of both 50 keV monochromatic images and material decomposition images over a 30-cm FoV for chain B when only 20 cm of chain B data were available for spectral extrapolation. CONCLUSIONS: Even with a moderate amount of training data, deep learning methods are capable of robustly inferring spectral contrast from feature-contrast relationships in spectral CT data, leading to spectral extrapolation performance well beyond what may be expected at face value. Future work reconciling spectral extrapolation results with original projection data is expected to further improve results in outlying and pathological cases.", "publication_location": "Med Phys", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mp.14324", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": "8", "news_mentions": " "},

Yet, with little empirical work directly linking preparatory neural activity to the performance benefits of advance cueing, it is not clear whether this relationship results from preparatory activation of task-specific networks, or from activity associated with general alerting processes. Here, fMRI data were acquired during a spatial Stroop task in which advance cues either informed subjects of the upcoming relevant feature of conflict stimuli (spatial or semantic) or were neutral. Informative cues decreased reaction time (RT) relative to neutral cues, and cues indicating that spatial information would be task-relevant elicited greater activity than neutral cues in multiple areas, including right anterior prefrontal and bilateral parietal cortex. Additionally, preparatory activation in bilateral parietal cortex and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex predicted faster RT when subjects responded to spatial location. No regions were found to be specific to semantic cues at conventional thresholds, and lowering the threshold further revealed little overlap between activity associated with spatial and semantic cueing effects, thereby demonstrating a single dissociation between activations related to preparing a spatial versus semantic task-set. This relationship between preparatory activation of spatial processing networks and efficient conflict resolution suggests that advance information can benefit performance by leading to domain-specific biasing of task-relevant information.", "publication_location": "Brain Research", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2007.07.060", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

However, the extent to which regions of this core brain network are also responsible for our capacity to think about what could have happened in our past, yet did not occur (i.e., episodic counterfactual thinking), is still unknown. The present study examined this issue. Using a variation of the experimental recombination paradigm (Addis, Pan, Vu, Laiser, & Schacter, 2009. Neuropsychologia. 47: 2222-2238), participants were asked both to remember personal past events and to envision alternative outcomes to such events while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Three sets of analyses were performed on the imaging data in order to investigate two related issues. First, a mean-centered spatiotemporal partial least square (PLS) analysis identified a pattern of brain activity across regions of the core network that was common to episodic memory and episodic counterfactual thinking. Second, a non-rotated PLS analysis identified two different patterns of brain activity for likely and unlikely episodic counterfactual thoughts, with the former showing significant overlap with the set of regions engaged during episodic recollection. Finally, a parametric modulation was conducted to explore the differential engagement of brain regions during counterfactual thinking, revealing that areas such as the parahippocampal gyrus and the right hippocampus were modulated by the subjective likelihood of counterfactual simulations. These results suggest that episodic counterfactual thinking engages regions that form the core brain network, and also that the subjective likelihood of our counterfactual thoughts modulates the engagement of different areas within this set of regions.", "publication_location": "Neuropsychologia", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.01.015", "citations": "65", "readership": "157", "tweets": "4", "news_mentions": " "},

We found that cued orienting of auditory spatial attention activated a medial-superior distributed fronto-parietal network. In addition, we found cue-triggered increases of activity in the auditory sensory cortex prior to the occurrence of an auditory target, suggesting that auditory attentional control operates in part by biasing processing in sensory cortex in favor of expected target stimuli. Finally, an exploratory cross-study comparison further indicated several common frontal and parietal regions as being involved in the control of both visual and auditory spatial attention. Thus, the present findings not only reveal the network of brain areas underlying endogenous spatial orienting in the auditory modality, but also suggest that the control of spatial attention in different sensory modalities is enabled in part by some common, supramodal neural mechanisms.", "publication_location": "Brain Research", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2006.11.088", "citations": "114", "readership": "175", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The effects of DBS depend strongly on stimulation frequency: high frequencies (>90 Hz) improve motor symptoms, while low frequencies (<50 Hz) are either ineffective or exacerbate symptoms. The neuronal basis for these frequency-dependent effects of DBS is unclear. The effects of different frequencies of STN-DBS on behavior and single-unit neuronal activity in the basal ganglia were studied in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rat model of PD. Only high-frequency DBS reversed motor symptoms, and the effectiveness of DBS depended strongly on stimulation frequency in a manner reminiscent of its clinical effects in persons with PD. Quantification of single-unit activity in the globus pallidus externa (GPe) and substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) revealed that high-frequency DBS, but not low-frequency DBS, reduced pathological low-frequency oscillations (∼9 Hz) and entrained neurons to fire at the stimulation frequency. Similarly, the coherence between simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons within and across GPe and SNr shifted from the pathological low-frequency band to the stimulation frequency during high-frequency DBS, but not during low-frequency DBS. The changes in firing patterns in basal ganglia neurons were not correlated with changes in firing rate. These results indicate that high-frequency DBS is more effective than low-frequency DBS, not as a result of changes in firing rate, but rather due to its ability to replace pathological low-frequency network oscillations with a regularized pattern of neuronal firing.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2824-12.2012", "citations": "120", "readership": "187", "tweets": "2", "news_mentions": " "},

However, it is not clear how the loop exerts control over the motor pathway. To study the mechanism, we used expression of the neural activity-induced gene ZENK (or egr-1), which shows singing-regulated expression in a social context-dependent manner: high levels in both pathways when singing undirected and low levels in the lateral part of the loop and in the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) of the motor pathway when singing directed to another animal. Here, we show that there are two parallel interactive parts within the pallial basal ganglia loop, lateral and medial, which modulate singing-driven ZENK expression of the motor pathway nuclei RA and HVC, respectively. Within the loop, the striatal and pallial nuclei appear to have opposing roles; the striatal vocal nucleus lateral AreaX is required for high ZENK expression in its downstream nuclei, particularly during undirected singing, while the pallial vocal lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium is required for lower expression, particularly during directed singing.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 9282 pairs of optic disc photographs and SDOCT optic nerve head scans from 927 eyes of 490 subjects were randomly divided into the validation plus training (80%) and test sets (20%). A DL convolutional neural network was trained to predict the SDOCT BMO-MRW global and sector values when evaluating optic disc photographs. The predictions of the DL network were compared to the actual SDOCT measurements. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the ability of the network to discriminate glaucomatous visual field loss from normal eyes. RESULTS: The DL predictions of global BMO-MRW from all optic disc photographs in the test set (mean ± standard deviation [SD]: 228.8 ± 63.1 μm) were highly correlated with the observed values from SDOCT (mean ± SD: 226.0 ± 73.8 μm) (Pearson's r = 0.88; R2 = 77%; P < .001), with mean absolute error of the predictions of 27.8 μm.

We have independently carried out mathematical and computer modelling of learning and 'unlearning' in a collective neural network of 30-1,000 neurones. The model network has a content-addressable memory or 'associative memory' which allows it to learn and store many memories. A particular memory can be evoked in its entirety when the network is stimulated by any adequate-sized subpart of the information of that memory. But different memories of the same size are not equally easy to recall. Also, when memories are learned, spurious memories are also created and can also be evoked. Applying an 'unlearning' process, similar to the learning processes but with a reversed sign and starting from a noise input, enhances the performance of the network in accessing real memories and in minimizing spurious ones.

It is important to reliably identify severe knee OA since total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can provide significant improvement in patient quality of life for patients with severe knee OA. In this study, we demonstrate a deep learning approach to automatically assessing KL grades. Our approach uses faster R-CNN object detection network to identify the knee region and deep convolutional neural network for classification. We used a dataset of 7962 knee radiographs for each posteroanterior (PA) and lateral (LAT) views, to develop and evaluate our approach.

This type of model is consistent with human performance in working memory tasks based on visual, auditory as well as temporal stimulus patterns. At the neural-network level, we focus on excitatory-inhibitory oscillatary processes that are able to encode both interval timing and working memory in a coupled excitatory-inhibitory network.

However, these functional changes may be due to age-related increased responsiveness to task demands and not to other cognitive processes on which neural and behavioural responses rely, since many ageing studies use task paradigms that may not be orthogonal to the cognitive function being investigated. Here we test this hypothesis in adults aged 20-86 years by combining measures of language comprehension, functional connectivity and neural integrity to identify functional networks activated in two language experiments with varying task demands. In one, participants listened to spoken sentences without performing an overt task (the natural listening condition) while in the other they performed a task in response to the same sentences. Using task-based ICA of fMRI, we identified a left-lateralised frontotemporal network associated with syntactic analysis, which remained consistently activated regardless of task demands. In contrast, in the task condition only a separate set of components showed task-specific activity in Opercular, Frontoparietal, and bilateral PFC. Only the PFC showed age-related increases in activation which, furthermore, was strongly mediated by grey matter health. These results suggest that, contrary to prevailing views, age-related changes in cognitive activation may be due in part to differential responses to task-related processes.", "publication_location": "Neuropsychologia", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.08.017", "citations": "33", "readership": "71", "tweets": "13", "news_mentions": " "},

The biological circuit was characterized by the presence of some heavily connected nuclei in contrast to the random networks that had equally distributed connections between their elements. This property of the analysed biological circuit was shown to account for a high logarithmic correlation found between two indexes defined to represent pointwise features of the nuclei and their global contribution to the whole network. The first index is obtained by the product of the number of inputs and of outputs of a nucleus and was called power index (PI). The second one, called occurrence index (OI), defines how many times a specific nucleus is crossed when all possible pathways joining two nuclei of the circuit are obtained. This PI-OI correlation was clearly dependent on the pathway length distribution (expressed in number of synapses), and was maximal considering pathways with a low number of synapses. When randomly connected circuits were analysed lower correlation was found between the same two indexes and only for much longer pathways. Therefore, it is proposed that the analysis of the PI-OI correlation can be useful to quantify structural differences between biological neural circuits as distinguished from randomly connected networks and also between neural systems at different levels of phylogenetic and ontogenetic development.", "publication_location": "Computers in Biology and Medicine", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0010-4825(90)90019-l", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Social cognition - considering someone's mind - recognizes the other as a human being subject to moral treatment. Social neuroscience has reliably shown that participants normally activate a social-cognition neural network to pictures and thoughts of other people; our previous work shows that parts of this network uniquely fail to engage for traditionally dehumanized targets (homeless persons or drug addicts; see Harris & Fiske, 2009, for review). This suggests participants may not consider these dehumanized groups' minds. Study 1 demonstrates that participants do fail to spontaneously think about the contents of these targets' minds when imagining a day in their life, and rate them differently on a number of human-perception dimensions. Study 2 shows that these human-perception dimension ratings correlate with activation in brain regions beyond the social-cognition network, including areas implicated in disgust, attention, and cognitive control.

The current workaround is running multiple neural network copies of which the average value of each synaptic weight is close to that in the original network. To improve the computation accuracy and reduce the incurred hardware cost, in this work, we investigate seven different regularization functions in the cost function of the learning process on TrueNorth platform. The hypothesis is that the quantization loss in the mapping from the trained network in floating-point data format to TrueNorth chip with limited integer values shall be minimized if the discrepancy between the trained weight and the quantized weights by optimizing the training process. Our experimental results proved that the proposed techniques considerably improve the computation accuracy of TrueNorth platform and reduce the incurred hardware and performance overheads.

A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study demonstrated that the engagement of the right prefrontal cortex during the cognitive evaluation of angry and fearful facial expressions is associated with an attenuation of the response of the amygdala to these same stimuli, providing evidence for a functional neural network for emotional regulation. METHODS:In the current study, we have explored the generalizability of this functional network by using threatening and fearful non-face stimuli derived from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), as well as the influence of this network on peripheral autonomic responses. RESULTS:Similar to the earlier findings with facial expressions, blood oxygen level dependent fMRI revealed that whereas perceptual processing of IAPS stimuli was associated with a bilateral amygdala response, cognitive evaluation of these same stimuli was associated with attenuation of this amygdala response and a correlated increase in response of the right prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, this pattern was reflected in changes in skin conductance.

Firing rates have very wide distributions, due to the variability in the connectivity from neuron to neuron. ISI histograms are exponential, except for small intervals. Thus the spike emission processes are well approximated by a Poisson process. The variability of the spike emission process is effectively controlled by the magnitude of the post-spike reset potential relative to the mean depolarization of the cell. Cross-correlations (CC) exhibit a central peak near zero delay, flanked by damped oscillations. The magnitude of the central peak in the CCs depends both on the probability that a spike emitted by a neuron affects another randomly chosen neuron and on firing rates. It increases when average rates decrease. Individual CCs depend very weakly on the synaptic interactions between the pairs of neurons. The dependence of individual CCs on the rates of the pair of neurons is in agreement with experimental data.

Deficits in social information processing and emotion regulation are important components of many human psychiatric illnesses, such as autism, schizophrenia and social anxiety disorder. Analyzing the neurobiology of social information processing and emotion regulation requires a multidisciplinary approach that benefits from comparative studies of humans and animal models. However, many questions remain regarding the relationship between visual attention and arousal while processing social stimuli. Using noninvasive infrared eye-tracking methods, we measured the visual social attention and physiological arousal (pupil diameter) of adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) as they watched social and nonsocial videos. We found that social videos, as compared to nonsocial videos, captured more visual attention, especially if the social signals depicted in the videos were directed towards the subject. Subject-directed social cues and nonsocial nature documentary footage, compared to videos showing conspecifics engaging in naturalistic social interactions, generated larger pupil diameters (indicating heightened sympathetic arousal). These findings indicate that rhesus monkeys will actively engage in watching videos of various kinds. Moreover, infrared eye tracking technology provides a mechanism for sensitively gauging the social interest of presented stimuli. Adult male rhesus monkeys' visual attention and physiological arousal do not always trend in the same direction, and are likely influenced by the content and novelty of a particular visual stimulus. This experiment creates a strong foundation for future experiments that will examine the neural network responsible for social information processing in nonhuman primates.

The objective of this work was to determine whether bladder activation evoked by pudendal afferent stimulation was dependent on the temporal pattern of stimulation, and whether specific temporal patterns of stimulation produced larger bladder contractions than constant frequency stimulation.The mean and maximum contraction pressures evoked by different temporal patterns of stimulation of the dorsal genital branch of the pudendal nerve were measured under isovolumetric conditions in α-chloralose anesthetized cats. A computational model of the spinal neural network mediating the pudendo-vesical reflex was used to understand the mechanisms of different bladder responses to patterned stimulation.The pattern of stimulation significantly affected the magnitude of evoked bladder contractions; several temporal patterns were as effective as regular stimulation, but no pattern evoked larger bladder contractions. Random patterns and patterns with pauses, burst-like activity, or high frequency components evoked significantly smaller bladder contractions, supporting the use of regular frequency stimulation in the development of neural prosthetic approaches for bladder control.These results reveal that the bladder response to pudendal afferent stimulation is dependent on the pattern, as well as the frequency, of stimulation. The computational model revealed that the effects of patterned pudendal afferent stimulation were determined by the dynamic properties of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in the lumbosacral spinal cord.

Brain pathways for vocal learning have been studied in the three bird groups and in humans. Here I present a hypothesis on the relationships and evolution of brain pathways for vocal learning among birds and humans. The three vocal learning bird groups each appear to have seven similar but not identical cerebral vocal nuclei distributed into two vocal pathways, one posterior and one anterior. Humans also appear to have a posterior vocal pathway, which includes projections from the face motor cortex to brainstem vocal lower motor neurons, and an anterior vocal pathway, which includes a strip of premotor cortex, the anterior basal ganglia, and the anterior thalamus. These vocal pathways are not found in vocal non-learning birds or mammals, but are similar to brain pathways used for other types of learning. Thus, I argue that if vocal learning evolved independently among birds and humans, then it did so under strong genetic constraints of a pre-existing basic neural network of the vertebrate brain.", "publication_location": "Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1196/annals.1298.038", "citations": "360", "readership": "325", "tweets": "4", "news_mentions": "7"},

One of the subclones, the GT1-7 cells, was characterized at both the light and electron microscopic levels to study the cellular and subcellular organization of these cells, particularly as they relate to biosynthesis, processing, and secretion. The cells were fixed onto slides 18-36 h after plating. LHRH and GnRH-associated peptide (GAP) immunoreactivities (IR) were detected by immunocytochemistry using colloidal gold labeling. These cultured cells exhibited the classical neuronal appearance of LHRH neurons, and they established numerous interconnections. Neighboring neurons were coupled by tight junctions, while more distant cells were interconnected with neural axon-like processes and collaterals. This cellular organization is suggestive of a neural network where neuronal activity is coordinated. At the ultrastructural level, the nondividing cells possessed indented nuclei, well developed Golgi complexes, and abundant numbers of ribosomes and secretory granules. Clathrin-coated vesicles were found in fusion with the plasma membrane. The ribosomes and secretory vesicles were particularly prominent, suggestive of high rates of protein biosynthesis and secretion. All of the cells immunostained for both LHRH and GAP; however, GAP IR was always more pronounced than that for LHRH. This finding was corroborated by biochemical data reported in a companion paper. The GAP IR was associated with ribosomes and secretory vesicles. By comparison, LHRH IR was restricted mainly to the secretory vesicles. Using colloidal gold particles of different sizes to denote LHRH or GAP IR, it was determined that both GAP and LHRH IR were colocalized within the same secretory vesicle. Taken together, these data suggest that pro-LHRH is biosynthesized on the ribosomes, packaged as an intact protein into the secretory vesicles, processed to LHRH and GAP-(1-56) within these vesicles, and transported to the periphery of the cell in preparation for secretion. These morphological data emphasize the utility of using these immortalized LHRH neuronal cells to dissect the cellular and subcellular architecture involved in biosynthesis, processing, and secretion. In addition, our results provide the first detailed evidence for the intracellular pathway involved in pro-LHRH biosynthesis, processing, and secretion in these cultured neuronal cells.", "publication_location": "Endocrinology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/endo-129-3-1575", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Concurrently, patients with depression may have decreased activation of attentional executive regions in response to attentional stimuli. This study examined the effect of bupropion XL, an extended release formulation of the nonserotonergic antidepressant agent bupropion, using a paradigm that investigated both negative emotional response and attentional processing. METHOD: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans and clinical ratings were obtained for 10 patients with DSM-IV-TR-defined major depressive disorder (mean [SD] age = 41 [+/- 7] years, mean [SD] Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D] score = 21 [+/- 4]) before and after 8 weeks of treatment with bupropion XL. The fMRI sessions were conducted during administration of the Emotional Oddball Task; scans were obtained while subjects viewed emotional distracters and performed an attentional executive function task. The primary outcome was fMRI activations evoked by the emotional distracters. The first baseline fMRI scan was performed in December 2004, and the last posttreatment scan was in March 2005. RESULTS: Treatment with bupropion XL was associated with improvements in HAM-D and Clinical Global Impressions scale ratings (p < .05). Treatment reduced fMRI activation during emotional distracters in several regions including right orbital frontal cortex, left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, right ventromedial prefrontal cortex, right anterior cingulate cortex, right inferior frontal cortex, right amygdala/parahippocampal area, right caudate, right fusiform gyrus, and left posterior cingulate. In addition, changes in fMRI activation in the amygdala correlated with improvements on the HAM-D (p < .05). Treatment increased activation to attentional targets in the following regions: right middle and inferior frontal gyri, right caudate, and bilateral precuneus. CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of a small sample size and the lack of a placebo control group, this study demonstrated that bupropion XL therapy for 8 weeks may attenuate emotion-induced, blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activation responses in the amygdala and related brain regions. Such attenuation may be associated with a positive clinical response in depression. Bupropion XL also improved activation in the executive-function neural network.

Thirty-six subjects (11 with passivity and 25 without passivity) with schizophrenia were compared with 32 age-, gender- and handedness-matched healthy controls using diffusion tensor imaging. Neuropsychological testing was administered. Patients with passivity were associated with increased fractional anisotropy within the frontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and basal ganglia and decreased fractional anisotropy within the thalamus when compared with patients without passivity. Within patients with passivity, fractional anisotropy in the frontal cortex correlated with the age of onset of illness and neurocognitive deficits related to attention and executive functioning.

Recent evidence suggests that ALLO's anxiolytic effects appear to be mediated by the amygdala, a key neural structure for emotional and cognitive behaviors. However, little is known regarding ALLO effects on amygdala physiology. We therefore explored ALLO effects on GABA neurotransmission in the central nucleus (Ce) of the amygdala, a major output nucleus involved in fear and anxiety. We recorded evoked GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in Ce neurons using whole-cell patch clamp techniques. We observed that ALLO significantly reduced the amplitude of evoked GABA(A) receptor-mediated IPSCs. However, the effect of ALLO was occluded by the NMDA receptor antagonist D-APV. D-APV alone also reduced evoked IPSCs in Ce neurons. These results suggest that ALLO-induced reduction of GABAergic transmission in Ce appears to depend on neural network activity, possibly involving an NMDA receptor-mediated mechanism.

Individual analysis for each emotional condition, and second-level t-tests examining both within-, and between-group differences, were carried out using a random effects approach. Psychophysiological interactions (PPI) were tested for variations in functional connectivity between amygdala and other brain regions as a function of changes in experimental conditions (labeling versus matching).During the labeling condition, both groups engaged similar networks. During the matching condition, schizophrenics failed to activate regions of the limbic system implicated in the automatic processing of emotions. PPI revealed an inverse functional connectivity between prefrontal regions and the left amygdala in healthy volunteers but there was no such change in patients. Furthermore, during the matching condition, and compared to controls, patients showed decreased activation of regions involved in holistic face processing (fusiform gyrus) and increased activation of regions associated with feature analysis (inferior parietal cortex, left middle temporal lobe, right precuneus).Our findings suggest that schizophrenic patients invariably adopt a cognitive approach when identifying facial affect.

Here we tested the proposal of 2 dissociable, distracter-specific conflict resolution mechanisms, by acquiring functional magnetic resonance imaging data during resolution of conflict from either nonemotional or emotional distracters. The results revealed 2 distinct circuits: a lateral prefrontal \"cognitive control\" system that resolved nonemotional conflict and was associated with enhanced processing of task-relevant stimuli in sensory cortices, and a rostral anterior cingulate \"emotional control\" system that resolved emotional conflict and was associated with decreased amygdalar responses to emotional distracters. By contrast, activations related to both emotional and nonemotional conflict monitoring were observed in a common region of the dorsal anterior cingulate.

For example, conflict effects on interference tasks, such as the Stroop task, are reduced subsequent to high-conflict trials relative to low-conflict trials. This interaction effect between previous and current trial types is called \"conflict adaptation\" and thought to be due to processing adjustments in cognitive control. The current study aimed to identify the neural substrates of cognitive control during conflict adaptation by isolating neural correlates of reduced conflict from those of increased cognitive control. We expected cognitive control to be implemented by prefrontal cortex through context-specific modulation of posterior regions involved in sensory and motor aspects of task performance. We collected event-related fMRI data on a color-word naming Stroop task and found distinct fronto-parietal networks of current trial conflict detection and conflict adaptation through cognitive control. Conflict adaptation was associated with increased activity in left middle frontal gyrus (GFm) and superior frontal gyrus (GFs), consistent with increased cognitive control, and with decreased activity in bilateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, consistent with reduced response conflict. Psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI) revealed that cognitive control activation in GFs and GFm was accompanied by increased functional integration with bilateral inferior frontal, right temporal and parietal areas, and the anterior cerebellum.

J. Neurophysiol. 80: 2790-2796, 1998. Large-scale neural interactions were characterized in human subjects as they learned that an auditory stimulus signaled a visual event. Once learned, activation of left dorsal occipital cortex (increased regional cerebral blood flow) was observed when the auditory stimulus was presented alone. Partial least-squares analysis of the interregional correlations (functional connectivity) between the occipital area and the rest of the brain identified a pattern of covariation with four dominant brain areas that could have mediated this activation: prefrontal cortex (near Brodmann area 10, A10), premotor cortex (A6), superior temporal cortex (A41/42), and contralateral occipital cortex (A18). Interactions among these regions and the occipital area were quantified with structural equation modeling to identify the strongest sources of the effect on left occipital activity (effective connectivity). Learning-related changes in feedback effects from A10 and A41/42 appeared to account for this change in occipital activity. Influences from these areas on the occipital area were initially suppressive, or negative, becoming facilitory, or positive, as the association between the auditory and visual stimuli was acquired. Evaluating the total effects within the functional models showed positive influences throughout the network, suggesting enhanced interactions may have primed the system for the now-expected visual discrimination.

In this article, we propose a new behavioral thermal modeling method for fast building performance analysis, which is critical for energy-efficient smart building control and management. The new approach is based on two recurrent neutral network architecture to obtain the compact nonlinear thermal models for complicated building. We start with a more realistic building simulation program, EnergyPlus, from Department of Energy, to model some practical buildings such as office buildings and data centers. EnergyPlus can model the various time-series inputs to a building such as ambient temperature, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) inputs, power consumption of electronic equipment, lighting and number of occupants in a room sampled in each hour and produce resulting temperature traces of zones (rooms). In this work, we apply two recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures to build the non-linear compact thermal model of the building: one is non-linear state-space RNN architecture (NLSS), which has global feedbacks, and the other one is Elman's RNN architecture (ELNN), which has local feedbacks in each layer. We give a simple formula to calculate the RNN layer number, layer size to configure RNN architecture to avoid overfitting and underfitting problems. A cross-validation based training technique is further applied to improve predictable accuracy of models. Experimental results from a case study of three buildings show that ELNN and NLSS can both build very accurate building thermal models for the 2-zone and 5-zone building cases: both of them have average errors from around 1% to 1.5% for the two buildings. For the more complex 6-zone building case, ELNN outperforms NLSS with maximum errors 16% against 23%.

Radiogenomics is a field of investigation that attempts to examine the relationship between imaging characteris-tics of cancerous lesions and their genomic composition. This could offer a noninvasive alternative to establishing genomic characteristics of tumors and aid cancer treatment planning. While deep learning has shown its supe-riority in many detection and classification tasks, breast cancer radiogenomic data suffers from a very limited number of training examples, which renders the training of the neural network for this problem directly and with no pretraining a very difficult task. In this study, we investigated an alternative deep learning approach referred to as deep features or off-the-shelf network approach to classify breast cancer molecular subtypes using breast dynamic contrast enhanced MRIs. We used the feature maps of different convolution layers and fully connected layers as features and trained support vector machines using these features for prediction. For the feature maps that have multiple layers, max-pooling was performed along each channel. We focused on distinguishing the Luminal A subtype from other subtypes. To evaluate the models, 10 fold cross-validation was performed and the final AUC was obtained by averaging the performance of all the folds. The highest average AUC obtained was 0.64 (0.95 CI: 0.57-0.71), using the feature maps of the last fully connected layer. This indicates the promise of using this approach to predict the breast cancer molecular subtypes. Since the best performance appears in the last fully connected layer, it also implies that breast cancer molecular subtypes may relate to high level image features.", "publication_location": "Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging   Proceedings of Spie", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2295471", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

This time-consuming task typically requires expert radiologists to read the images, leading to fatigue-based diagnostic error and lack of diagnostic expertise in areas of the world where radiologists are not available. Recently, deep learning approaches have been able to achieve expert-level performance in medical image interpretation tasks, powered by large network architectures and fueled by the emergence of large labeled datasets. The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of a deep learning algorithm on the detection of pathologies in chest radiographs compared with practicing radiologists. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed CheXNeXt, a convolutional neural network to concurrently detect the presence of 14 different pathologies, including pneumonia, pleural effusion, pulmonary masses, and nodules in frontal-view chest radiographs. CheXNeXt was trained and internally validated on the ChestX-ray8 dataset, with a held-out validation set consisting of 420 images, sampled to contain at least 50 cases of each of the original pathology labels. On this validation set, the majority vote of a panel of 3 board-certified cardiothoracic specialist radiologists served as reference standard. We compared CheXNeXt's discriminative performance on the validation set to the performance of 9 radiologists using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The radiologists included 6 board-certified radiologists (average experience 12 years, range 4-28 years) and 3 senior radiology residents, from 3 academic institutions. We found that CheXNeXt achieved radiologist-level performance on 11 pathologies and did not achieve radiologist-level performance on 3 pathologies. The radiologists achieved statistically significantly higher AUC performance on cardiomegaly, emphysema, and hiatal hernia, with AUCs of 0.888 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.863-0.910), 0.911 (95% CI 0.866-0.947), and 0.985 (95% CI 0.974-0.991), respectively, whereas CheXNeXt's AUCs were 0.831 (95% CI 0.790-0.870), 0.704 (95% CI 0.567-0.833), and 0.851 (95% CI 0.785-0.909), respectively. CheXNeXt performed better than radiologists in detecting atelectasis, with an AUC of 0.862 (95% CI 0.825-0.895), statistically significantly higher than radiologists' AUC of 0.808 (95% CI 0.777-0.838); there were no statistically significant differences in AUCs for the other 10 pathologies. The average time to interpret the 420 images in the validation set was substantially longer for the radiologists (240 minutes) than for CheXNeXt (1.5 minutes). The main limitations of our study are that neither CheXNeXt nor the radiologists were permitted to use patient history or review prior examinations and that evaluation was limited to a dataset from a single institution. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed and validated a deep learning algorithm that classified clinically important abnormalities in chest radiographs at a performance level comparable to practicing radiologists. Once tested prospectively in clinical settings, the algorithm could have the potential to expand patient access to chest radiograph diagnostics.", "publication_location": "Plos Medicine", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002686", "citations": "122", "readership": "368", "tweets": "183", "news_mentions": "6"},

We have used a novel computational and optogenetic approach to investigate whether these same memory processes hypothesized to support pattern recognition and short-term memory in vivo, exist in vitro. Electrophysiological activity was recorded from primary cultures of dissociated rat cortical neurons plated on multielectrode arrays. Cultures were transfected with ChannelRhodopsin-2 and optically stimulated using random dot stimuli. The pattern of neuronal activity resulting from this stimulation was analyzed using classification algorithms that enabled the identification of stimulus-specific memories. Fading memories for different stimuli, encoded in ongoing neural activity, persisted and could be distinguished from each other for as long as 1 s after stimulation was terminated. Hidden memories were detected by altered responses of neurons to additional stimulation, and this effect persisted longer than 1 s. Interestingly, network bursts seem to eliminate hidden memories.

In a homogeneous net work, in the oscillatory state all neurons fire in synchrony, while in a heterogeneous network synchrony is looser, many neurons skipping cycles of the oscillation. If the transmission of action potentials via the electrical synapses is effectively excitatory, the Hopf bifurcation is supercritical, while effectively inhibitory transmission due to pronounced hyperpolarization leads to a subcritical bifurcation.

Recent emergence of brain network analysis has made characterization of neurological disorders at a whole-brain connectivity level possible, thus providing new avenues for brain diseases classification. Employing multiple-kernel Support Vector Machines (SVMs), we attempt to integrate information from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) for improving classification performance.

Recent emergence of reliable network characterization techniques has made it possible to understand neurological disorders at a whole-brain connectivity level. Accordingly, we propose an effective network-based multivariate classification algorithm, using a collection of measures derived from white matter (WM) connectivity networks, to accurately identify MCI patients from normal controls. An enriched description of WM connections, utilizing six physiological parameters, i.e., fiber count, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and principal diffusivities(λ(1), λ(2), and λ(3)), results in six connectivity networks for each subject to account for the connection topology and the biophysical properties of the connections. Upon parcellating the brain into 90 regions-of-interest (ROIs), these properties can be quantified for each pair of regions with common traversing fibers. For building an MCI classifier, clustering coefficient of each ROI in relation to the remaining ROIs is extracted as feature for classification. These features are then ranked according to their Pearson correlation with respect to the clinical labels, and are further sieved to select the most discriminant subset of features using an SVM-based feature selection algorithm. Finally, support vector machines (SVMs) are trained using the selected subset of features. Classification accuracy was evaluated via leave-one-out cross-validation to ensure generalization of performance. The classification accuracy given by our enriched description of WM connections is 88.9%, which is an increase of at least 14.8% from that using simple WM connectivity description with any single physiological parameter.

We explored the transcriptional networks that CHD8 regulates in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) by reducing its expression and then integrating transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing) with genome-wide CHD8 binding (ChIP sequencing). Suppressing CHD8 to levels comparable with the loss of a single allele caused altered expression of 1,756 genes, 64.9% of which were up-regulated. CHD8 showed widespread binding to chromatin, with 7,324 replicated sites that marked 5,658 genes. Integration of these data suggests that a limited array of direct regulatory effects of CHD8 produced a much larger network of secondary expression changes. Genes indirectly down-regulated (i.e., without CHD8-binding sites) reflect pathways involved in brain development, including synapse formation, neuron differentiation, cell adhesion, and axon guidance, whereas CHD8-bound genes are strongly associated with chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation. Genes associated with ASD were strongly enriched among indirectly down-regulated loci (P < 10(-8)) and CHD8-bound genes (P = 0.0043), which align with previously identified coexpression modules during fetal development. We also find an intriguing enrichment of cancer-related gene sets among CHD8-bound genes (P < 10(-10)). In vivo suppression of chd8 in zebrafish produced macrocephaly comparable to that of humans with inactivating mutations. These data indicate that heterozygous disruption of CHD8 precipitates a network of gene-expression changes involved in neurodevelopmental pathways in which many ASD-associated genes may converge on shared mechanisms of pathogenesis.", "publication_location": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1405266111", "citations": "176", "readership": "310", "tweets": "16", "news_mentions": " "},

However, SCS only provides 50% or greater pain relief to approximately 60% of patients, and the efficacy of SCS tends to decline over time. Efforts to optimize SCS have focused on the spatial aspects of SCS such as electrode design and electrode geometry while neglecting stimulation parameter selection and have assumed that the dorsal horn pain processing network is static. We developed a biophysical network model of the dorsal horn circuit capable of reproducing key electrophysiological data relevant to pain processing. Using this model, we simulated the effects of SCS applied at between 5 Hz and 150 Hz on the activity of projection neurons responsible for relaying pain signals to the brain. SCS at 30-100 Hz produced maximal inhibition of projection neuron activity. Furthermore, we quantified responses to SCS with diminished levels of inhibition in the dorsal horn to simulate the effect of disease progression. The degree to which projection neurons were inhibited by SCS declined as the strength of inhibitory mechanisms was reduced, and the optimal SCS frequency decreased to 15 Hz. Our simulation results suggest that the efficacy of SCS is dependent on stimulation frequency and that the loss of dorsal horn inhibition during chronic pain may explain the decline in SCS efficacy over time. These findings provide insights regarding the mechanisms of SCS and pave the way for improved SCS stimulation parameter selection. © 2013 IEEE.", "publication_location": "International Ieee/Embs Conference on Neural Engineering, Ner", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/NER.2013.6696135", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

This is particularly relevant as postural control implicates dysfunction in the cerebellum-a region implicated in cognitive dysmetria conceptions of schizophrenia but poorly understood in the prodrome. Here, we extended our understanding of movement abnormalities in UHR individuals to include postural control, and have linked these deficits to both symptom severity and cerebello-cortical network connectivity. UHR and healthy control participants completed an instrumentally based balance task to quantify postural control along with a resting state brain imaging scan to investigate cerebellar networks. We also quantified positive and negative symptom severity with structured clinical interviews. The UHR group showed overall increased postural sway and decreased cerebello-cortical resting state connectivity, relative to controls. The decreased cerebello-cortical connectivity was seen across multiple networks. Postural sway was also correlated with cerebellar connectivity in this population and uniquely positively correlated with the severity of negative symptoms. Finally, symptom severity was also associated with cerebellar connectivity. Together, our results point to a potential deficit in sensory integration as an underlying contributor to the increased postural sway, and provide evidence of cerebellar abnormalities in UHR individuals. These results extend our understanding of the motor abnormalities of UHR individuals beyond striatum-based dyskinesias to include postural control and sensory integration deficits, and implicate the cerebellum as a distinct neural substrate preceding the onset of psychosis.

Yet, the role of this kind of activity in encoding sensory information remains largely unknown. To understand the rules of translation between the structure of sensory stimuli and the fluctuations of cortical responses, we simulated a sparsely connected network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons modeling a local cortical population, and we determined how the LFPs generated by the network encode information about input stimuli. We first considered simple static and periodic stimuli and then naturalistic input stimuli based on electrophysiological recordings from the thalamus of anesthetized monkeys watching natural movie scenes. We found that the simulated network produced stimulus-related LFP changes that were in striking agreement with the LFPs obtained from the primary visual cortex. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the network encoded static input spike rates into gamma-range oscillations generated by inhibitory-excitatory neural interactions and encoded slow dynamic features of the input into slow LFP fluctuations mediated by stimulus-neural interactions. The model cortical network processed dynamic stimuli with naturalistic temporal structure by using low and high response frequencies as independent communication channels, again in agreement with recent reports from visual cortex responses to naturalistic movies. One potential function of this frequency decomposition into independent information channels operated by the cortical network may be that of enhancing the capacity of the cortical column to encode our complex sensory environment.", "publication_location": "Plos Computational Biology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000239", "citations": "163", "readership": "392", "tweets": "1", "news_mentions": " "},

The medial temporal lobe memory system, including the hippocampus and surrounding cortex, encodes surprising events and is influenced by motivational state. Because behavior reflects the goals of an individual, we investigated whether motivational valence (i.e., pursuing rewards versus avoiding punishments) also impacts neural and mnemonic encoding of surprising events. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants encountered perceptually unexpected events either during the pursuit of rewards or avoidance of punishments. Despite similar levels of motivation across groups, reward and punishment facilitated the processing of surprising events in different medial temporal lobe regions. Whereas during reward motivation, perceptual surprises enhanced activation in the hippocampus, during punishment motivation surprises instead enhanced activation in parahippocampal cortex. Further, we found that reward motivation facilitated hippocampal coupling with ventromedial PFC, whereas punishment motivation facilitated parahippocampal cortical coupling with orbitofrontal cortex. Behaviorally, post-scan testing revealed that reward, but not punishment, motivation resulted in greater memory selectivity for surprising events encountered during goal pursuit. Together these findings demonstrate that neuromodulatory systems engaged by anticipation of reward and punishment target separate components of the medial temporal lobe, modulating medial temporal lobe sensitivity and connectivity. Thus, reward and punishment motivation yield distinct neural contexts for learning, with distinct consequences for how surprises are incorporated into predictive mnemonic models of the environment.", "publication_location": "Neurobiol Learn Mem", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2016.01.018", "citations": "20", "readership": "75", "tweets": "6", "news_mentions": " "},

This property may be exploited to summarize information content succinctly. This paper tests the hypothesis that information contained in ensemble activity recorded from the primate motor cortex about limb movements is preserved when the activity is projected onto a sparse basis.

In the past decade, cognitive neuroscientists have begun to uncover the neural underpinnings of CFT, particularly episodic CFT (eCFT), which activates regions in the default network (DN) also activated by episodic memory (eM) recall. However, the engagement of DN regions is different for distinct kinds of eCFT. More plausible counterfactuals and counterfactuals about oneself show stronger activity in DN regions compared to implausible and other- or object-focused counterfactuals. The current study sought to identify a source for this difference in DN activity. Specifically, self-focused counterfactuals may also be more plausible, suggesting that DN core regions are sensitive to the plausibility of a simulation. On the other hand, plausible and self-focused counterfactuals may involve more episodic information than implausible and other-focused counterfactuals, which would imply DN sensitivity to episodic information. In the current study, we compared episodic and semantic counterfactuals generated to be plausible or implausible against episodic and semantic memory reactivation using fMRI. Taking multivariate and univariate approaches, we found that the DN is engaged more during episodic simulations, including eM and all eCFT, than during semantic simulations. Semantic simulations engaged more inferior temporal and lateral occipital regions. The only region that showed strong plausibility effects was the hippocampus, which was significantly engaged for implausible CFT but not for plausible CFT, suggestive of binding more disparate information.

The current study compares brain activity during counterfactual simulations involving the self, others and objects. In addition, counterfactual thoughts involving others were manipulated in terms of similarity and familiarity with the simulated characters. The results indicate greater involvement of DN during person-based (i.e., self and other) as opposed to object-based counterfactual simulations. However, the involvement of different regions of the DN during other-based counterfactual simulations was modulated by how close and/or similar the simulated character was perceived to be by the participant. Simulations involving unfamiliar characters preferentially recruited dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Simulations involving unfamiliar similar characters, characters with whom participants identified personality traits, recruited lateral temporal gyrus. Finally, our results also revealed differential coupling of right hippocampus with lateral prefrontal and temporal cortex during counterfactual simulations involving familiar similar others, but with left transverse temporal gyrus and medial frontal and inferior temporal gyri during counterfactual simulations involving either oneself or unfamiliar dissimilar others.

An activation overlap may occur because a region is involved in operations tapped by different cognitive functions or because the activated area comprises subregions differentially involved in each of the functions. To investigate these issues, we directly compared brain activity during episodic retrieval (ER) and working memory (WM) using event-related functional MRI (fMRI). ER was investigated with a word recognition test, and WM was investigated with a word delayed-response test. Two-phase trials distinguished between retrieval mode and cue-specific aspects of ER, as well as between encoding/maintenance and retrieval aspects of WM. The results revealed a common fronto-parieto-cerebellar network for ER and WM, as well as subregions differentially involved in each function. Specifically, there were two main findings. First, the results differentiated common and specific subregions within the prefrontal cortex: (i) left dorsolateral areas were recruited by both functions, possibly reflecting monitoring operations; (ii) bilateral anterior and ventrolateral areas were more activated during ER than during WM, possibly reflecting retrieval mode and cue-specific ER operations, respectively; and (iii) left posterior/ventral (Broca's area) and bilateral posterior/dorsal areas were more activated during WM than during ER, possibly reflecting phonological and generic WM operations, respectively. Second, hippocampal and parahippocampal regions were activated not only for ER but also for WM. This result suggests that indexing operations mediated by the medial temporal lobes apply to both long-term and short-term memory traces.

Here, we paired a novel spatial cueing task with fMRI to investigate contingent capture as a function of the affective salience of bottom-up cues (face stimuli) and individual differences in trait anxiety. In the absence of top-down cues, exogenous stimuli validly cueing targets facilitated attention in low-anxious participants, regardless of affective salience. However, although high-anxious participants exhibited similar facilitation following neutral exogenous cues, this facilitation was completely absent following affectively negative exogenous cues. Critically, these effects were contingent on endogenous attentional settings, such that explicit top-down cues presented before the appearance of exogenous stimuli removed anxious individuals' sensitivity to affectively salient stimuli. fMRI analyses revealed a network of brain regions underlying this variability in affective contingent capture across individuals, including the fusiform face area (FFA), posterior ventrolateral frontal cortex, and SMA.

A multi-dipole model, brain electric source analysis (BESA), was used to explore the dipole sources responsible for the MEG activities. We found that MEG activity differences between the W1st(C) and the C4th(C) condition occurred in the period of 190-220 ms (M190 and M200), and 300-440 ms (M300 and M370) mainly at the supramarginal gyrus, the dorsolateral prefrontal, and the middle and inferior frontal gyrus.

While no evidence from single units is available, it has been assumed that IEDs destroy information represented in neuronal networks. Cultured neuronal networks are a model for generic cortical microcircuits, and their spontaneous activity is characterized by the presence of synchronized network bursts (SNBs), which share a number of properties with IEDs, including the high degree of synchronization and their spontaneous occurrence in the absence of an external stimulus. As a model approach to understanding the processes underlying IEDs, optogenetic stimulation and multielectrode array (MEA) recordings of cultured neuronal networks were used to study whether stimulus information represented in these networks survives SNBs. When such networks are optically stimulated they encode and maintain stimulus information for as long as one second. Experiments involved recording the network response to a single stimulus and trials where two different stimuli were presented sequentially, akin to a paired pulse trial. We broke the sequential stimulus trials into encoding, delay and readout phases and found that regardless of which phase the SNB occurs, stimulus-specific information was impaired. SNBs were observed to increase the mean network firing rate, but this did not translate monotonically into increases in network entropy. It was found that the more excitable a network, the more stereotyped its response was during a network burst. These measurements speak to whether SNBs are capable of transmitting information in addition to blocking it. These results are consistent with previous reports and provide baseline predictions concerning the neural mechanisms by which IEDs might cause TCI.", "publication_location": "Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnint.2015.00014", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

In distributed machine learning, while a great deal of attention has been paid on centralized systems that include a central parameter server, decentralized systems have not been fully explored. Decentralized systems have great potentials in the future practical use as they have multiple useful attributes such as less vulnerable to privacy and security issues, better scalability, and less prone to single point of bottleneck and failure. In this paper, we focus on decentralized learning systems and aim to achieve differential privacy with good convergence rate and low communication cost. To achieve this goal, we propose a new algorithm, Leader-Follower Elastic Averaging Stochastic Gradient Descent (LEASGD), driven by a novel Leader-Follower topology and differential privacy model. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence rate of LEASGD and the trade-off between the performance and privacy in the private setting. We evaluate LEASGD in real distributed testbed with poplar deep neural network models MNIST-CNN, MNIST-RNN, and CIFAR-10. Extensive experimental results show that LEASGD outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized learning algorithm DPSGD by achieving nearly 40% lower loss function within same iterations and by 30% reduction of communication cost.

Here we investigate neuronal responses in the rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus (VPM) during a tactile discrimination task that requires animals to associate two different tactile stimuli with two corresponding choices of spatial trajectory to be rewarded. To manipulate reward expectation, neuronal activity observed under regular reward contingency (CR) was compared with neuronal activity recorded during freely rewarded (FR) trials, in which animals obtained reward regardless of their choice of spatial trajectory. Across-trial firing rates of S1 and VPM neurons varied according to the reward contingency of the task. Analysis of neuronal ensemble activity by an artificial neural network showed that stimulus-related information in S1 and VPM increased from stimulus sampling to reward delivery in CR trials but decreased to chance levels when animals performed FR trials, when stimulus discrimination was irrelevant for task execution. Neuronal ensemble activity in VPM was only correlated with task performance during stimulus presentation. In contrast, S1 neuronal activity was highly correlated with task performance long after stimulus removal, a relationship that peaked during the 300 ms that preceded reward delivery.

This limitation may be overcome by considering a set of genes simultaneously where the gene sets are derived from prior biological knowledge. Limited work has been carried out in the regression setting to study the effects of clinical covariates and expression levels of genes in a pathway either on a continuous or on a binary clinical outcome. Hence, we propose a Bayesian approach for identifying pathways related to both types of outcomes. We compare our Bayesian approaches with a likelihood-based approach that was developed by relating a least squares kernel machine for nonparametric pathway effect with a restricted maximum likelihood for variance components. Unlike the likelihood-based approach, the Bayesian approach allows us to directly estimate all parameters and pathway effects. It can incorporate prior knowledge into Bayesian hierarchical model formulation and makes inference by using the posterior samples without asymptotic theory. We consider several kernels (Gaussian, polynomial, and neural network kernels) to characterize gene expression effects in a pathway on clinical outcomes. Our simulation results suggest that the Bayesian approach has more accurate coverage probability than the likelihood-based approach, and this is especially so when the sample size is small compared with the number of genes being studied in a pathway.

One key application of WCE is to measure language input heard by infants and toddlers in their natural environments, as captured by daylong recordings from microphones worn by the infants. Although WCE is nearly trivial for high-quality signals in high-resource languages, daylong recordings are substantially more challenging due to the unconstrained acoustic environments and the presence of near- and far-field speech. Moreover, many use cases of interest involve languages for which reliable ASR systems or even well-defined lexicons are not available. A good WCE system should also perform similarly for low- and high-resource languages in order to enable unbiased comparisons across different cultures and environments. Unfortunately, the current state-of- the-art solution, the LENA system, is based on proprietary software and has only been optimized for American English, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we build on existing work on WCE and present the steps we have taken towards a freely available system for WCE that can be adapted to different languages or dialects with a limited amount of orthographically transcribed speech data. Our system is based on language-independent syllabification of speech, followed by a language-dependent mapping from syllable counts (and a number of other acoustic features) to the corresponding word count estimates. We evaluate our system on samples from daylong infant recordings from six different corpora consisting of several languages and socioeconomic environments, all manually annotated with the same protocol to allow direct comparison. We compare a number of alternative techniques for the two key components in our system: speech activity detection and automatic syllabification of speech. As a result, we show that our system can reach relatively consistent WCE accuracy across multiple corpora and languages (with some limitations). In addition, the system outperforms LENA on three of the four corpora consisting of different varieties of English. We also demonstrate how an automatic neural network-based syllabifier, when trained on multiple languages, generalizes well to novel languages beyond the training data, outperforming two previously proposed unsupervised syllabifiers as a feature extractor for WCE.", "publication_location": " ", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/xp6k2", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": "4", "news_mentions": " "},

Learning semantic representations and tree structures of bilingual phrases is beneficial for statistical machine translation.

We incorporate word alignments into BCorrRAE to allow it freely access bilingual constraints at different levels. BCorrRAE minimizes a joint objective on the combination of a recursive autoencoder reconstruction error, a structural alignment consistency error and a crosslingual reconstruction error so as to not only generate alignment-consistent phrase structures, but also capture different levels of semantic relations within bilingual phrases. In order to examine the effectiveness of BCorrRAE, we incorporate both semantic and structural similarity features built on bilingual phrase representations and tree structures learned by BCorrRAE into a state-of-the-art SMT system.

All rights reserved. Background: Silent brain infarction (SBI) is defined as the presence of 1 or more brain lesions, presumed to be because of vascular occlusion, found by neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography) in patients without clinical manifestations of stroke. It is more common than stroke and can be detected in 20% of healthy elderly people. Early detection of SBI may mitigate the risk of stroke by offering preventative treatment plans. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques offer an opportunity to systematically identify SBI cases from electronic health records (EHRs) by extracting, normalizing, and classifying SBI-related incidental findings interpreted by radiologists from neuroimaging reports. Objective: This study aimed to develop NLP systems to determine individuals with incidentally discovered SBIs from neuroimaging reports at 2 sites: Mayo Clinic and Tufts Medical Center. Methods: Both rule-based and machine learning approaches were adopted in developing the NLP system. The rule-based system was implemented using the open source NLP pipeline MedTagger, developed by Mayo Clinic. Features for rule-based systems, including significant words and patterns related to SBI, were generated using pointwise mutual information. The machine learning models adopted convolutional neural network (CNN), random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression. The performance of the NLP algorithm was compared with a manually created gold standard. The gold standard dataset includes 1000 radiology reports randomly retrieved from the 2 study sites (Mayo and Tufts) corresponding to patients with no prior or current diagnosis of stroke or dementia. 400 out of the 1000 reports were randomly sampled and double read to determine interannotator agreements. The gold standard dataset was equally split to 3 subsets for training, developing, and testing. Results: Among the 400 reports selected to determine interannotator agreement, 5 reports were removed due to invalid scan types. The interannotator agreements across Mayo and Tufts neuroimaging reports were 0.87 and 0.91, respectively. The rule-based system yielded the best performance of predicting SBI with an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.991, 0.925, 1.000, 1.000, and 0.990, respectively. The CNN achieved the best score on predicting white matter disease (WMD) with an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.994, 0.994, 0.994, 0.994, and 0.994, respectively. Conclusions: We adopted a standardized data abstraction and modeling process to developed NLP techniques (rule-based and machine learning) to detect incidental SBIs and WMDs from annotated neuroimaging reports.

One key application of WCE is to measure language input heard by infants and toddlers in their natural environments, as captured by daylong recordings from microphones worn by the infants. Although WCE is nearly trivial for high-quality signals in high-resource languages, daylong recordings are substantially more challenging due to the unconstrained acoustic environments and the presence of near- and far-field speech. Moreover, many use cases of interest involve languages for which reliable ASR systems or even well-defined lexicons are not available. A good WCE system should also perform similarly for low- and high-resource languages in order to enable unbiased comparisons across different cultures and environments. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art solution, the LENA system, is based on proprietary software and has only been optimized for American English, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we build on existing work on WCE and present the steps we have taken towards a freely available system for WCE that can be adapted to different languages or dialects with a limited amount of orthographically transcribed speech data. Our system is based on language-independent syllabification of speech, followed by a language-dependent mapping from syllable counts (and a number of other acoustic features) to the corresponding word count estimates. We evaluate our system on samples from daylong infant recordings from six different corpora consisting of several languages and socioeconomic environments, all manually annotated with the same protocol to allow direct comparison. We compare a number of alternative techniques for the two key components in our system: speech activity detection and automatic syllabification of speech. As a result, we show that our system can reach relatively consistent WCE accuracy across multiple corpora and languages (with some limitations). In addition, the system outperforms LENA on three of the four corpora consisting of different varieties of English. We also demonstrate how an automatic neural network-based syllabifier, when trained on multiple languages, generalizes well to novel languages beyond the training data, outperforming two previously proposed unsupervised syllabifiers as a feature extractor for WCE.", "publication_location": "Speech Communication", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.specom.2019.08.005", "citations": "3", "readership": "26", "tweets": "13", "news_mentions": " "},

In this paper, we challenge this assumption and show how to carefully design multi-step approaches that provide better performance-complexity trade-offs than their few-step counterparts. We consider the recently proposed learned digital backpropagation (LDBP) approach, where the linear steps in the split-step method are re-interpreted as general linear functions, similar to the weight matrices in a deep neural network. Our main contribution lies in an experimental demonstration of this approach for a 25 Gbaud single-channel optical transmission system. It is shown how LDBP can be integrated into a coherent receiver DSP chain and successfully trained in the presence of various hardware impairments. Our results show that LDBP with limited complexity can achieve better performance than standard DBP by using very short, but jointly optimized, finite-impulse response filters in each step.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a RIS/PACS (Radiology Information System/Picture Archiving and Communication System) search engine, we obtained 100 consecutive abdominal CTs with at least one of the following findings: free-gas, free-fluid, or fat-stranding and 100 control cases with absence of these findings. The CT data were analyzed using a convolutional neural network algorithm previously trained for detection of these findings on an independent sample. The validation of the results was performed on a Web-based feedback system by a radiologist with 1 year of experience in abdominal imaging without prior knowledge of image findings through both visual confirmation and comparison with the clinically approved, written report as the standard of reference. All cases were included in the final analysis, except those in which the whole dataset could not be processed by the detection software. Measures of diagnostic accuracy were then calculated. RESULTS: A total of 194 cases were included in the analysis, 6 excluded because of technical problems during the extraction of the DICOM datasets from the local PACS. Overall, the algorithm achieved a 93% sensitivity (91/98, 7 false-negative) and 97% specificity (93/96, 3 false-positive) in the detection of acute abdominal findings.

An important problem in fiber-optic communications is to invert the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in real time to reverse the deterministic effects of the channel. Interestingly, the popular split-step Fourier method (SSFM) leads to a computation graph that is reminiscent of a deep neural network. This observation allows one to leverage tools from machine learning to reduce complexity. In particular, the main disadvantage of the SSFM is that its complexity using M steps is at least M times larger than a linear equalizer. This is because the linear SSFM operator is a dense matrix. In previous work, truncation methods such as frequency sampling, wavelets, or least-squares have been used to obtain 'cheaper' operators that can be implemented using filters. However, a large number of filter taps are typically required to limit truncation errors. For example, Ip and Kahn showed that for a 10 Gbaud signal and 2000 km optical link, a truncated SSFM with 25 steps would require 70-tap filters in each step and 100 times more operations than linear equalization. We find that, by jointly optimizing all filters with deep learning, the complexity can be reduced significantly for similar accuracy. Using optimized 5-tap and 3-tap filters in an alternating fashion, one requires only around 2-6 times the complexity of linear equalization, depending on the implementation.", "publication_location": "Ieee International Symposium on Information Theory   Proceedings", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2018.8437734", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

This paper explores the use of a recently designed Support Vector Machine (SVM)/Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) Oracle hybrid to classify breast lesions and evaluate the software's performance as an interpretive aid to radiologists.

For determination and evaluation of similarity measures, the \"gold standard\" of similarities for 300 pairs of masses was determined by 10 breast radiologists. For determining similarity measures that would agree with radiologists' similarity determination, an artificial neural network (ANN) was trained with the radiologists' subjective similarity ratings and the image features. The image features were determined subjectively using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lesion descriptors and objectively by computerized image analysis. The similarity measures determined by the ANN were compared to the gold standard and evaluated in terms of the correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The similarity measures determined using the BI-RADS descriptors only were not as useful as those determined by use of the image features only. When the BI-RADS margin ratings were combined with the image features, the correlation coefficient between the subjective ratings and the objective measures improved slightly (r = 0.76) compared to those based on the image features alone (r = 0.74).

The authors have been developing a computerized scheme for automatically selecting similar images with clustered microcalcifications on mammograms from a large database. For similar images to be useful, they must be similar from the point of view of the diagnosing radiologists. In order to select such images, subjective similarity ratings were obtained for a number of pairs of clustered microcalcifications by breast radiologists for establishment of a \"gold standard\" of image similarity, and the gold standard was employed for determination and evaluation of the selection of similar images. The images used in this study were obtained from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography developed by the University of South Florida. The subjective similarity ratings for 300 pairs of images with clustered microcalcifications were determined by ten breast radiologists. The authors determined a number of image features which represent the characteristics of clustered microcalcifications that radiologists would use in their diagnosis. For determination of objective similarity measures, an artificial neural network (ANN) was employed. The ANN was trained with the average subjective similarity ratings as teacher and selected image features as input data. The ANN was trained to learn the relationship between the image features and the radiologists' similarity ratings; therefore, once the training was completed, the ANN was able to determine the similarity, called a psychophysical similarity measure, which was expected to be close to radiologists' impressions, for an unknown pair of clustered microcalcifications. By use of a leave-one-out test method, the best combination of features was selected. The correlation coefficient between the gold standard and the psychophysical similarity measure through the use of seven features was relatively high (r=0.71) and was comparable to the correlation coefficients between the ratings by one radiologist and the average ratings by nine radiologists (r=0.69 +/- 0.07). The correlation coefficient was improved compared to that of a distance-based method (r=0.58). The result indicated that similar images selected by the psychophysical similarity measure may be useful to radiologists in the diagnosis of clustered microcalcifications on mammograms.", "publication_location": "Medical Physics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1118/1.3020760", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Sixty pairs of masses were selected from 1445 mass images prepared for this study, which were obtained from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography by the University of South Florida. Five radiologists provided subjective similarity ratings for these 60 pairs of masses based on the overall impression for diagnosis. Radiologists' subjective ratings were marked on a continuous rating scale and quantified between 0 and 1, which correspond to pairs not similar at all and pairs almost identical, respectively. By use of the subjective ratings as \"gold standard,\" similarity measures based on the Euclidean distance between pairs in feature space and the psychophysical measure were determined. For determination of the psychophysical similarity measure, an artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to learn the relationship between radiologists' average subjective similarity ratings and computer-extracted image features. To evaluate the usefulness of the similarity measures, the agreement with the radiologists' subjective similarity ratings was assessed in terms of correlation coefficients between the average subjective ratings and the similarity measures. A commonly used similarity measure based on the Euclidean distance was moderately correlated (r=0.644) with the radiologists' average subjective ratings, whereas the psychophysical measure by use of the ANN was highly correlated (r=0.798).

The development of reliable computerized detection of ETs in the EEG could assist physicians in interpreting rsEEGs. We report progress in developing a standardized database for testing and training ET detection algorithms. We describe a new version of our EEGnet software system for collecting expert opinion on EEG datasets, a completely web-browser based system. We report results of EEG scoring from a group of 11 board-certified academic clinical neurophysiologists who annotated 30-s excepts from rsEEG recordings from 100 different patients. The scorers had moderate inter-scorer reliability and low to moderate intra-scorer reliability. In order to measure the optimal size of this standardized rsEEG database, we used machine learning models to classify paroxysmal EEG activity in our database into ET and non-ET classes.

The joint posterior probability mass function of target class, features, and classification estimates is learned from labeled data, and recursively updated as additional images become available. Based on the learned joint probability mass function, the approach presented in this paper predicts the expected confidence level of future target classifications, prior to obtaining new images. The proposed approach is tested with a set of simulated sonar image data. The numerical results show that the estimated confidence level provides a close approximation to the actual confidence level value determined a posteriori, i.e. after the new image is obtained by the on-board sensor.

With the recent technological advances, we can perform high-throughput screening at an affordable cost using minimal plasma. Monitoring brain health after an injury is critical since mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) and other neurological symptoms are under-diagnosed. Our objective in this study is to present our preliminary serological data from one of our ongoing studies on mTBI. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we used stored plasma samples to understand biomarkers of mTBI. We compared plasma samples from five patients with mTBI following their first concussive episode to five gender and age-matched healthy controls. We assessed multiple biomarkers to show the importance of biorepositories. RESULTS: Most of the estimated plasma factors in mTBI subjects at baseline were comparable to normal healthy individuals except for the astroglial markers S100B and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Fluctuations of these biomarkers can affect the homeostasis of brain parenchyma by altering the neural network signaling, which in turn may result in intermittent behavioral symptoms.

METHODS: Seven patterns of stimulation were tested in nine subjects with thalamic DBS for essential tremor: stimulation 'off', three ramped-frequency stimulation (RFS) trains from 130 → 50 Hz, 130 → 60 Hz, and 235 → 90 Hz, and three constant frequency stimulation (CFS) trains at 72, 82, and 130 Hz. The same patterns were applied to a computational model of the thalamic neural network. RESULTS: Temporally patterned 130 → 60 Hz ramped-frequency trains suppressed tremor relative to stimulation 'off,' but 130 → 50 Hz, 130 → 60 Hz, and 235 → 90 Hz ramped-frequency trains were no more effective than constant frequency stimulation with the same mean interpulse interval (IPI). Computational modeling revealed that rhythmic burst-driver inputs to thalamus were masked during DBS, but long IPIs, concurrent with pauses in afferent cerebellar and cortical firing, allowed propagation of bursting activity. The mean firing rate of bursting-type model neurons as well as the firing pattern entropy of model neurons were both strongly correlated with tremor power across stimulation conditions. CONCLUSION: Frequency-ramped DBS produced equivalent tremor suppression as constant frequency thalamic DBS. Tremor-related thalamic burst activity may result from burst-driver input, rather than by an intrinsic rebound mechanism. SIGNIFICANCE: Ramping stimulation frequency may exacerbate thalamic burst firing by introducing consecutive pauses of increasing duration to the stimulation pattern.", "publication_location": "Clin Neurophysiol", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2019.11.060", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": "3", "news_mentions": " "},

To improve diagnostic performance, here we introduce an approach to optimize a decision-fusion technique to combine heterogeneous information, such as from different modalities, feature categories, or institutions. For classifier comparison we used two performance metrics: The receiving operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve [area under the ROC curve (AUC)] and the normalized partial area under the curve (pAUC). This study used four classifiers: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), artificial neural network (ANN), and two variants of our decision-fusion technique, AUC-optimized (DF-A) and pAUC-optimized (DF-P) decision fusion. We applied each of these classifiers with 100-fold cross-validation to two heterogeneous breast cancer data sets: One of mass lesion features and a much more challenging one of microcalcification lesion features. For the calcification data set, DF-A outperformed the other classifiers in terms of AUC (p < 0.02) and achieved AUC=0.85 +/- 0.01. The DF-P surpassed the other classifiers in terms of pAUC (p < 0.01) and reached pAUC=0.38 +/- 0.02. For the mass data set, DF-A outperformed both the ANN and the LDA (p < 0.04) and achieved AUC=0.94 +/- 0.01. Although for this data set there were no statistically significant differences among the classifiers' pAUC values (pAUC=0.57 +/- 0.07 to 0.67 +/- 0.05, p > 0.10), the DF-P did significantly improve specificity versus the LDA at both 98% and 100% sensitivity (p < 0.04).

The methodology, referred to as the Surrogate-Model Accelerated Random Search (SMARS) algorithm, is a non-gradient based iterative application of a random search algorithm and the surrogate-model method for optimization. The random search algorithm drives the global search portion of SMARS, thoroughly probing the search space to find optimal regions. The surrogate-model method then applies an artificial neural network to map local regions of the search space, and produce computationally inexpensive estimates to the solution, thereby accelerating the search. Through simulated examples, the SMARS algorithm is shown to be both robust and efficient. First, the minimization of a well known function with multiple local minima was considered to demonstrate the SMARS optimization capabilities with a known complex response surface. Then, two examples were considered for the inverse characterization of material properties. The identification of parameters of a rheological viscoelasticity model was considered first, and shows the SMARS algorithm's tolerance to non-uniqueness over a large search space. Lastly, the identification of the distribution of thermal diffusivity for a functionally graded material was considered, and displays the SMARS capabilities to solve high-dimensional inverse problems. In all three examples, the performances of two traditional global search algorithms, a genetic algorithm and a random search algorithm, were compared to that of the SMARS algorithm. In all cases, the SMARS algorithm outperformed both traditional algorithms by attaining more accurate solutions with fewer function evaluations. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed methodology searches for complete thermal constitutive models as opposed to identifying parameters in predetermined functional forms. The application of this new methodology is illustrated using a simulated steady-state heat conduction problem. It was found in simulated experiments that the self-learning finite element method can inversely recover accurate NN representations of thermal constitutive models using simple temperature measurements. Moreover, the method showed stability in the presence of imperfect or noisy data.

DP-DT processes the multi-angle data using a phase retrieval algorithm that is extended by a deep image prior (DIP), which reparameterizes the 3D sample reconstruction with an untrained, deep generative 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). We show that DP-DT effectively addresses the missing cone problem, which otherwise degrades the resolution and quality of standard 3D reconstruction algorithms. As DP-DT does not require pre-captured data or pre-training, it is not biased towards any particular dataset. Hence, it is a general technique that can be applied to a wide variety of 3D samples, including scenarios in which large datasets for supervised training would be infeasible or expensive. We applied DP-DT to obtain 3D RI maps of bead phantoms and complex biological specimens, both in simulation and experiment, and show that DP-DT produces higher-quality results than standard regularization techniques. We further demonstrate the generality of DP-DT, using two different scattering models, the first Born and multi-slice models.

In the artificial neural network (ANN), the most time-consuming part for parametric modeling of microwave components is the collection of training datasets from full-wave electromagnetic simulations. However, the reported models for parametric modeling of EM behaviors are based on supervised learning, in which the labeled sampling data from full-wave EM simulations ought to be sufficient for ANN training. Thus, the number of full-wave simulations is the main factor that influences the effectiveness of collecting training and testing samples. Based on the dynamic adjustment kernel extreme learning machine, this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning model lying between supervised learning and unsupervised learning to largely reduce the number of required training samples. The proposed model contains two training processes, the initial training, and the self-training. In the initial training process, a small number of training samples from full-wave simulations are used to make the model rapidly converge. Then, in the self-training process, the model produces unlabeled training datasets to train itself till the testing accuracy is satisfied. Two numerical examples of a microstrip-to-microstrip vertical transition and a dual-band four-pole filter are employed to verify the effectiveness of the semi-supervised learning model.", "publication_location": "Ieee Access", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2904765", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Published by Elsevier Inc. PURPOSE: Cardiac transplant patients must be on lifelong surveillance for the occurrence of acute cellular rejection (ACR). Despite potent immunosuppressants, ACR occurs when recipient T cells recognize donor antigens to cause cardiac myocyte destruction. Identifying myocyte damage is critical for determining the grade of rejection, and thus greatly impacts treatment decisions. The aim of this study is to determine if a machine learning algorithm can reach acceptable performance of identifying myocyte damage representative of ACR from benign conditions. AI technology has recently been under robust investigation in cancer pathology but is in its infancy in transplant pathology. This is the first AI algorithm to our knowledge, to identify myocyte damage in cardiac transplant patients. METHODS: All regions of myocyte damage were annotated by a board-certified cardiac pathologist at a high-volume cardiac transplant center. Cases diagnosed as antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) were excluded. Annotations were extracted using the Openslide software and fed into a convolutional neural network which used the locked VGG16 base for transfer learning. Keras was used for AI modeling and training. Four annotation classes were included in the algorithm (normal, healing injury, Grade 1R1A and Grade 1R2). RESULTS: A total of 19,617 annotations (10,855 regions of ACR, 5002 healing injury, 3760 normal) were completed from 200 hematoxylin and eosin slides scanned using a Leica Aperio AT2 digital whole slide scanner at 40X magnification. The AI algorithm successfully distinguished myocyte damage (Grade 1R2) from non-myocyte damage (Grade 1R1A) with 94% validation accuracy. ACR was distinguished from healing injury with 98-99% validation accuracy, and from normal cardiac myocytes with 99% validation accuracy. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for the first time, that a machine learning algorithm can be taught and validated to distinguish myocyte damage ACR from non-myocyte damage ACR. To our knowledge, this is one of the first AI tools developed in cardiac transplant pathology that may be used as an adjunct tool to decrease inter-observer diagnostic variability and reduce diagnostic error amongst pathologists.", "publication_location": "J Heart Lung Transplant", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.healun.2020.01.1250", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The use of Neural Network (NN)-based controllers has attracted significant attention in recent years. Yet, due to the complexity and non-linearity of such NN-based cyber-physical systems (CPS), existing verification techniques that employ exhaustive state-space search, face significant scalability challenges; this effectively limits their use for analysis of real-world CPS. In this work, we focus on the use of Statistical Model Checking (SMC) for verifying complex NN-controlled CPS. Using an SMC approach based on Clopper-Pearson confidence levels, we verify from samples specifications that are captured by Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulas. Specifically, we consider three CPS benchmarks with varying levels of plant and controller complexity, as well as the type of considered STL properties - reachability property for a mountain car, safety property for a bipedal robot, and control performance of the closed-loop magnet levitation system. On these benchmarks, we show that SMC methods can be successfully used to provide high-assurance for learning-based CPS.", "publication_location": "Hscc 2020   Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control ,Part of Cps Iot Week", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3365365.3382209", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Information about the contiguity of successive stimuli in the training sequence, representing the fact that training is done on a set of uncorrelated stimuli presented in a fixed temporal sequence, is embedded in the synaptic structure. The model reproduces quite accurately the correlations between delay activity distributions corresponding to stimulation with the uncorrelated stimuli used for training. It reproduces also the activity distributions of spike rates on sample cells as a function of the stimulating pattern. It is, in our view, the first time that a computational phenomenon, represented on the neurophysiological level, is reproduced in all its quantitative aspects. The model is then used to make predictions about further features of the physiology of such experiments. Those include further properties of the correlations, features of selective cells as discriminators of stimuli provoking different delay activity distributions, and activity distributions among the neurons in a delay activity produced by a given pattern. The model has predictive implications also for the dependence of the delay activities on different training protocols.

Clinical records were reviewed for the presence of acquired risk factors (RF) for thrombosis and events associated with aPL. Univariate statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact testing. A neural network statistical model was also used to identify which thrombophilic risk factors were most important in development of arterial and venous thrombosis. RESULTS: For arterial thrombosis, hypertension, tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus were the most important predictors of thrombosis. By contrast, tobacco use, the 3' PTG and factor V(R506Q) polymorphisms, and previous cardiac surgery were the most important predictors of venous thrombosis. CONCLUSION: In this hypothesis-generating retrospective study, acquired risk factors were most important in arterial thrombosis, while the presence of factor V(R506Q) and 3' PTG polymorphisms were more important in the development of venous thrombosis.

The number of signal events is extracted through a simultaneous fit to the dijet mass spectrum in three classes of events: events likely to contain jets with a heavy-quark decay, events likely to contain jets originating from light quarks, and events that fail these identification criteria.

Algorithmic alternatives using standard clinical and pathology information may provide equivalent benefit in settings where genomic tests, such as OncotypeDx, are unavailable. We developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model to nonlinearly estimate risk of distant cancer recurrence. In addition to clinical and pathological variables, we enhanced our model using intraoperatively determined global mammographic breast density (MBD) and local breast density (LBD). LBD was measured with optical spectral imaging capable of sensing regional concentrations of tissue constituents. A cohort of 56 ER+ patients with an OncotypeDx score was evaluated. We demonstrated that combining MBD/LBD measurements with clinical and pathological variables improves distant recurrence risk prediction accuracy, with high correlation (r = 0.98) to the OncotypeDx recurrence score.

Analysis of the amino acid sequences of this domain from 245 different HIV-1 isolates revealed that the PND is less variable than thought originally. Conservation to better than 80 percent of the amino acids in 9 out of 14 positions in the central portion of the PND and the occurrence of particular oligopeptide sequences in a majority of the isolates suggest that there are constraints on PND variability. One constraining influence may be the structural motif (beta strand--type II beta turn--beta strand--alpha helix) predicted for the consensus PND sequence by a neural network approach. Isolates with a PND similar to the commonly investigated human T cell lymphoma virus IIIB (HTLV-IIIB) and LAV-1 (BRU) strains were rare, and only 14 percent of sera from 86 randomly selected HIV-1 seropositive donors contained antibodies that recognized the PND of these virus isolates. In contrast, over 65 percent of these sera reacted with peptides containing more common PND sequences. These results suggest that HIV vaccine immunogens chosen because of their similarity to the consensus PND sequence and structure are likely to induce antibodies that neutralize a majority of HIV-1 isolates.", "publication_location": "Science (New York, N.Y.)", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.2392685", "citations": "583", "readership": "24", "tweets": "1", "news_mentions": " "},

Inclusive four-jet events produced in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of s=7 TeV are analysed for the presence of hard double-parton scattering using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 37.3 pb−1, collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The contribution of hard double-parton scattering to the production of four-jet events is extracted using an artificial neural network, assuming that hard double-parton scattering can be approximated by an uncorrelated overlaying of dijet events. For events containing at least four jets with transverse momentum pT ≥ 20 GeV and pseudorapidity |η| ≤ 4.4, and at least one having pT ≥ 42.5 GeV, the contribution of hard double-parton scattering is estimated to be fDPS = 0.092− 0.011+ 0.005(stat.)− 0.037+ 0.033(syst.). After combining this measurement with those of the inclusive dijet and four-jet cross-sections in the appropriate phase space regions, the effective cross-section, σeff , was determined to be σeff = 14. 9− 1.0+ 1.2(stat.)− 3.8+ 5.1(syst.) mb. This result is consistent within the quoted uncertainties with previous measurements of σeff , performed at centre-of-mass energies between 63 GeV and 8 TeV using various final states, and it corresponds to 21− 6+ 7 % of the total inelastic cross-section measured at s=7 TeV.

Pre-training MD lesions impaired temporal differentiation of action duration, by increasing the dispersion of the duration distribution. Post-training MD lesions also impaired differentiation, but by reducing the average emitted press durations, thus shifting the distribution without increasing the dispersion. In Experiment 2, we trained rats to space their lever pressing above criterion inter-press-intervals in order to earn rewards.

Matrix-vector multiplication, as a key computing operation, has been largely adopted in applications and hence greatly affects the execution efficiency. A common technique to enhance the performance of matrix-vector multiplication is increasing execution parallelism, which results in higher design cost. In recent years, new devices and structures have been widely investigated as alternative solutions. Among them, memristor crossbar demonstrates a great potential for its intrinsic support of matrix-vector multiplication, high integration density, and built-in parallel execution. However, the computation accuracy and speed of such designs are limited and constrained by the features of crossbar array and peripheral circuitry. In this work, we propose a new memristor crossbar based computing engine design by leveraging a current sensing scheme. High operation parallelism and therefore fast computation can be achieved by simultaneously supplying analog voltages into a memristor crossbar and directly detecting weighted currents through current amplifiers. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed design were examined through the implementation of a neural network for pattern recognition based on MNIST database.

The large output layer, hidden layer, last hidden layer and the connections among them will generate enormous matrix in training. It is the main facts to influence the efficiency and scalability. At the same time, output layer class and small hidden layer should decrease the accuracy of RNNLM. In general, the lack of parallel for artificial neuron is main reason for these. We change the structure of RNNLM and design the new large-scale RNNLM by the center of distributed artificial neurons in hidden layer to stimulate the parallel characteristic of biological neuron system. Meanwhile, we change training method, and present the coordination strategy for distributed neuron. At last, the prototype of new large-scale RNNLM system is implemented based on Spark.

Purpose: When conducting machine learning algorithms on classification and detection of abnormalities for medical imaging, many researchers are faced with the problem that it is hard to get enough labeled data. This is especially difficult for modalities such as computed tomography (CT) with potentially 1000 or more slice images per case. To solve this problem, we plan to use machine learning algorithms to identify abnormalities within existing radiologist reports, thus creating case-level labels that may be used for weakly supervised training on the image data. We used a two-stage procedure to label the CT reports. In the first stage, a rule-based system labeled a smaller set of cases automatically with high accuracy. In the second stage, we developed machine learing algorithms using the labels from the rule-based system and word vectors learned without supervision from unlabeled CT reports. Method: In this study, we used approximately 24,000 CT reports from Duke University Health System. We initially focused on three organs, the lungs, liver/gallbladder, and kidneys. We first developed a rule-based system that can quickly identify certain types of abnormalities within CT reports with high accuracy. For each organ and disease combination, we produced several hundred cases with rule-based labels. These labels were combined with word vectors generated using word2vec from all the unlabeled reports to train two different machine learning algorithms: (a) average of word vectors merged by logistic regression, and (b) recurrent neural network (RNN). Result: Performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) over an independent test set of 440 reports for which those organs were manually labeled as normal or abnormal by clinical experts. For lungs, the performance was 0.796 for average word vector and 0.827 for RNN. Liver performance was 0.683 for average word vector and 0.791 for RNN. For kidneys, it was 0.786 for average word vector and 0.928 for RNN. Conclusion: It is possible to label large numbers of cases automatically.

Lack of annotated data is a major challenge to machine learning algorithms, particularly in the field of radiology. Algorithms that can efficiently extract labels in a fast and precise manner are in high demand. Weak supervision is a compromise solution, particularly, when dealing with imaging modalities like Computed Tomography (CT), where the number of slices can reach 1000 per case. Radiology reports store crucial information about clinicians' findings and observations in CT slices. Automatic generation of labels from CT reports is not a trivial task due to the complexity of sentences and diversity of expression in free-text narration. In this study, we focus on abnormality classification in lungs, liver and kidneys. Firstly, a rule-based model is used to extract weak labels at the case level. Afterwards, attention guided recurrent neural network (RNN) is trained to perform binary classification of radiology reports in terms of whether the organ is normal or abnormal. Additionally, a multi-label RNN with attention mechanism is trained to perform binary classification by aggregating its output for four representative diseases (lungs: emphysema, mass-nodule, effusion and atelectasis-pneumonia; liver: dilatation, fatty infiltration-steatosis, calcification-stone-gallstone, lesion-mass; kidneys: atrophy, cyst, stone-calculi, lesion) into a single abnormal class. Performance has been evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) on 274, 306 and 278 reports for lungs, liver and kidneys correspondingly, manually annotated by radiology experts. The change in performance was evaluated for different sizes of training dataset for lungs.

We presented the flash during smooth pursuit of another target, so that there was a smooth change in eye position after the flash. We could then determine whether the flash-evoked saccades compensated for the intervening smooth eye movements to point the eyes at the position of the flash in space. We defined the \"retinal error\" as the vector from the position of the eye at the time of the flash to the position of the target. We defined \"spatial error\" as the vector from the position of the eye at the time of the saccade to the position of the flashed target in space. The direction of the saccade (in polar coordinates) was more highly correlated with the direction of the retinal error than with the direction of the spatial error. Saccade amplitude was also better correlated with the amplitude of the retinal error. We obtained the same results whether the flash was presented during pursuit with the head fixed or during pursuit with combined eye-head movements. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the direction of the saccade was determined only by the retinal error in two of the three monkeys. In the third monkey saccade direction was determined primarily by retinal error but had a consistent bias toward spatial error. The bias can be attributed to this monkey's earlier practice in which the flashed target was reilluminated so he could ultimately make a saccade to the correct position in space. These data suggest that the saccade generator does not normally use nonvisual feedback about smooth changes in eye or gaze position. In two monkeys we also provided sequential target flashes during pursuit with the second flash timed so that it occurred just before the first saccade. As above, the first saccade was appropriate for the retinal error provided by the first flash. The second saccade compensated for the first and pointed the eyes at the position of the second target in space. We conclude, as others have before (12, 21), that the saccade generator receives feedback about its own output, saccades. Our results require revision of existing models of the neural network that generates saccades. We suggest two models that retain the use of internal feedback suggested by others. We favor a model that accounts for our data by assuming that internal feedback originates directly from the output of the saccade generator and reports only saccadic changes in eye position.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neurophysiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.1986.56.1.196", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Advances in machine learning have markedly improved automated processing, but have yet to be applied to PC-CMR. This study tested a novel machine learning model for fully automated analysis of PC-CMR aortic flow. METHODS: A machine learning model was designed to track aortic valve borders based on neural network approaches. The model was trained in a derivation cohort encompassing 150 patients who underwent clinical PC-CMR then compared to manual and commercially-available automated segmentation in a prospective validation cohort. Further validation testing was performed in an external cohort acquired from a different site/CMR vendor. RESULTS: Among 190 coronary artery disease patients prospectively undergoing CMR on commercial scanners (84% 1.5T, 16% 3T), machine learning segmentation was uniformly successful, requiring no human intervention: Segmentation time was < 0.01 min/case (1.2 min for entire dataset); manual segmentation required 3.96 ± 0.36 min/case (12.5 h for entire dataset). Correlations between machine learning and manual segmentation-derived flow approached unity (r = 0.99, p < 0.001). Machine learning yielded smaller absolute differences with manual segmentation than did commercial automation (1.85 ± 1.80 vs. 3.33 ± 3.18 mL, p < 0.01): Nearly all (98%) of cases differed by ≤5 mL between machine learning and manual methods. Among patients without advanced mitral regurgitation, machine learning correlated well (r = 0.63, p < 0.001) and yielded small differences with cine-CMR stroke volume (∆ 1.3 ± 17.7 mL, p = 0.36). Among advanced mitral regurgitation patients, machine learning yielded lower stroke volume than did volumetric cine-CMR (∆ 12.6 ± 20.9 mL, p = 0.005), further supporting validity of this method. Among the external validation cohort (n = 80) acquired using a different CMR vendor, the algorithm yielded equivalently small differences (∆ 1.39 ± 1.77 mL, p = 0.4) and high correlations (r = 0.99, p < 0.001) with manual segmentation, including similar results in 20 patients with bicuspid or stenotic aortic valve pathology (∆ 1.71 ± 2.25 mL, p = 0.25). CONCLUSION: Fully automated machine learning PC-CMR segmentation performs robustly for aortic flow quantification - yielding rapid segmentation, small differences with manual segmentation, and identification of differential forward/left ventricular volumetric stroke volume in context of concomitant mitral regurgitation.

Since the neutrino oscillation probability depends on the neutrino energy, a measurement of the muon energy adds an important piece of information concerning the neutrino system. We show in this paper how the MACRO limited streamer tube system can be operated in drift mode by using the TDCs included in the QTPs, an electronics designed for magnetic monopole search. An improvement of the space resolution is obtained, through an analysis of the multiple scattering of muon tracks as they pass through our detector. This information can be used further to obtain an estimate of the energy of muons crossing the detector. Here we present the results of two dedicated tests, performed at CERN PS-T9 and SPS-X7 beam lines, to provide a full check of the electronics and to exploit the feasibility of such a multiple scattering analysis. We show that by using a neural network approach, we are able to reconstruct the muon energy for Eμ<40 GeV.

Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. Deep learning methods have shown great promise in tackling challenging medical imaging tasks. Within the field of x-ray CT, deep learning for image denoising is of interest because of the fundamental link between ionizing radiation dose and diagnostic image quality, the limited availability of clinical projection data, and the computational expense of iterative reconstruction methods. Here, we work with 3D, temporal CT data (4D, cardiac CT), where redundancies in spatial sampling necessitate careful control of imaging dose. Specifically, using custom extensions to the Tensorflow and Keras machine learning packages, we construct and train a 4D, convolutional neural network (CNN) to denoise helical, cardiac CT data acquired in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. With the objective of accelerating iterative reconstruction, we train the CNN to map undersampled algebraic reconstructions of the 4D data to fully-sampled and regularized iterative reconstructions under mean-squared-error, perceptual loss, and low rank cost terms. Using phantom data for quantitative validation, we verify that the CNN robustly denoises static potions of the image without compromising temporal fidelity and that the CNN performs similarly to regularized, iterative reconstruction with the split Bregman method (CNN temporal RMSE: 142 HU; iterative temporal RMSE: 136 HU). Using in vivo validation and testing data excluded from CNN training, we verify that the CNN generalizes well, approximately reproducing the noise power spectrum of the iteratively reconstructed data (noise std. in water vial near heart, CNN: 62-73 HU, depending on cardiac phase; iterative: 94-100 HU), without degradation of spatial resolution (axial MTF, 10% cutoff, CNN: 2.69 lp/mm; iterative: 2.63 lp/mm).

The superiority of iterative reconstruction techniques over analytical ones is documented in a variety of CT imaging applications. However, iterative reconstruction techniques generally require a substantial increase in data processing time and required resources, slowing adoption of the state of the art. This problem is exacerbated in multi-channel CT reconstruction problems (e.g. dynamic and spectral CT) where the gap between the amount of data acquired and to be reconstructed is often exaggerated. To facilitate adoption of iterative reconstruction techniques, we propose methods which seek to improve data efficiency. Specifically, we define data-efficient methods as those that produce reliable results with respect to task-specific metrics while managing the total x-ray exposure, sampling time, computation time, and computational resources required. The development of such methods unifies several themes in CT research, including dose management, task-based optimization, clinically relevant timelines for data processing, and reconstruction from undersampled data. In this paper, we present complementary, data-efficient methods for cardiac CT reconstruction. We present a reconstruction algorithm which requires minimal parameter tuning to solve temporal reconstruction problems. The algorithm exploits spatially localized, voxel-centric, distance-driven projection and backprojection operators to promote computational efficiency. We validate the algorithm with numerical simulations, using the MOBY mouse phantom, and with in vivo mouse data. For the in vivo data, localized reconstruction reduces computation time by 50% and system RAM requirements by 60% relative to non-localized reconstruction. Following validation of our algorithm, we present preliminary in vivo temporal denoising results using a convolutional neural network which promise to further improve the fidelity and speed of our reconstructions in future work.", "publication_location": "Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging   Proceedings of Spie", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2293628", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Although clinical stage, tumor grade, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and tumor volume assessment by biopsy positivity are established prognostic markers in prostate cancer, the need for additional serum markers is clear. In a prior neural network analysis by our group, serum creatinine appeared to improve staging and prognosis. Even though serum creatinine is one of the most common blood tests used by practicing urologists, it has not been tested rigorously as a potential staging/prognosis marker in localized prostate cancer. METHODS: The data on 409 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center between 1990 and 1996 were analyzed. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the ability of serum creatinine to predict the pathologic stage. The ability of creatinine to predict PSA recurrence was also assessed using Cox regression analysis. In multivariable analyses, creatinine was assessed while simultaneously controlling for race, age, prostate weight, clinical stage, Gleason (World Health Organization) grade, prostatism history, treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and pretreatment PSA level. RESULTS: Creatinine ranged from 0.1 to 2.3 mg/dL (mean and median 1.1 mg/dL). The relationship of creatinine to pathologic stage was significant (P = 0.050). As the level of creatinine increased, the proportion of patients with extraprostatic disease generally decreased. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, creatinine was not a significant predictor (P = 0.270).

Weakly supervised disease classification of CT imaging suffers from poor localization owing to case-level annotations, where even a positive scan can hold hundreds to thousands of negative slices along multiple planes. Furthermore, although deep learning segmentation and classification models extract distinctly unique combinations of anatomical features from the same target class(es), they are typically seen as two independent processes in a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) pipeline, with little to no feature reuse. In this research, we propose a medical classifier that leverages the semantic structural concepts learned via multi-resolution segmentation feature maps, to guide weakly supervised 3D classification of chest CT volumes. Additionally, a comparative analysis is drawn across two different types of feature aggregation to explore the vast possibilities surrounding feature fusion. Using a dataset of 1593 scans labeled on a case-level basis via rule-based model, we train a dual-stage convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform organ segmentation and binary classification of four representative diseases (emphysema, pneumonia/atelectasis, mass and nodules) in lungs. The baseline model, with separate stages for segmentation and classification, results in AUC of 0.791. Using identical hyperparameters, the connected architecture using static and dynamic feature aggregation improves performance to AUC of 0.832 and 0.851, respectively.

Each study consists of one low-resolution (5-mm section thickness) 3D CT image volume and its corresponding 3D, manually labeled volume. To improve modeling on such small sample size regime, we performed median frequency class balancing weighting in the loss function of the SegNet, data normalization adjusting for intensity coverage of CT volumes, data transformation to harmonize voxel resolution, CT section extrapolation to virtually increase the number of transverse sections available as inputs to the 2D multi-channel model, and data augmentation to simulate mildly rotated volumes.

We used fMRI and representational similarity analysis (RSA) to examine how visual and semantic representations predicted subsequent memory for single item encoding (e.g., seeing an orange). Three levels of visual representations corresponding to early, middle, and late visual processing stages were based on a deep neural network. Three levels of semantic representations were based on normative Observed (“is round”), Taxonomic (“is a fruit”), and Encyclopedic features (“is sweet”). We identified brain regions where each representation type predicted later Perceptual Memory, Conceptual Memory, or both (General Memory). Participants encoded objects during fMRI, and then completed both a word-based conceptual and picture-based perceptual memory test. Visual representations predicted subsequent Perceptual Memory in visual cortices, but also facilitated Conceptual and General Memory in more anterior regions. Semantic representations, in turn, predicted Perceptual Memory in visual cortex, Conceptual Memory in the perirhinal and inferior prefrontal cortex, and General Memory in the angular gyrus.

Particularly, the memristor technology that can naturally emulate plasticity and energy efficiency of biological synapses have gained a lot of attention. However, the use of memristors in high density computation, such as matrix-vector operation, is still missing.

In addition, a modern large-scaled design typically consists of many huge macros due to the wide use of intellectual properties (IPs). Empirically, the placement of these macros greatly determines routability, while there exists no effective cost metric to directly evaluate a macro placement because of the extremely high complexity and unpredictability of cell placement and routing.

Deep neural network (DNN) accelerators as an example of domain-specific architecture have demonstrated great success in DNN inference. However, the architecture acceleration for equally important DNN training has not yet been fully studied. With data forward, error backward and gradient calculation, DNN training is a more complicated process with higher computation and communication intensity. Because the recent research demonstrates a diminishing specialization return, namely, 'accelerator wall', we believe that a promising approach is to explore coarse-grained parallelism among multiple performance-bounded accelerators to support DNN training. Distributing computations on multiple heterogeneous accelerators to achieve high throughput and balanced execution, however, remaining challenging. We present AccPar, a principled and systematic method of determining the tensor partition among heterogeneous accelerator arrays. Compared to prior empirical or unsystematic methods, AccPar considers the complete tensor partition space and can reveal previously unknown new parallelism configurations. AccPar optimizes the performance based on a cost model that takes into account both computation and communication costs of a heterogeneous execution environment. Hence, our method can avoid the drawbacks of existing approaches that use communication as a proxy of the performance. The enhanced flexibility of tensor partitioning in AccPar allows the flexible ratio of computations to be distributed among accelerators with different performances. The proposed search algorithm is also applicable to the emerging multi-path patterns in modern DNNs such as ResNet. We simulate AccPar on a heterogeneous accelerator array composed of both TPU-v2 and TPU-v3 accelerators for the training of large-scale DNN models such as Alexnet, Vgg series, and Resnet series.

According to the model, inhibitory associations between the context (CX) and unconditioned stimulus (US) are formed during extinction, which help preserve the association between the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the US. However, summation and retardation tests fail to reveal these associations because (a) the CX is not attended or (b) a CX-CS configural stimulus formed during extinction is both poorly attended and weakly active during testing. When US presentations and testing occur in the same context, reinstatement is the consequence of a decreased CX inhibition and the increased attention to the CS, which activates the remaining CS-US association. When US presentations occur in the context of extinction but the CS is tested in a different context, reinstatement results from an increased attention to the CS and the combination of CS-CX and CX-US excitatory associations. The assumption that associations between CSs are impaired following neurotoxic hippocampal lesions or in amnesia, is sufficient to describe absence of reinstatement in those cases.

We also investigated the association of the rsFC changes with emotional arousability level to understand individual differences. There is significantly stronger functional connectivity between the left DLPFC and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) under sad mood than that under happy mood. The increased connectivity strength was positively correlated with subjects' emotional arousability. The increased positive correlation between the left DLPFC and PCC under sad relative to happy mood might reflect an increased processing of negative emotion-relevant stimuli. The easier one was induced by strong negative emotion (higher emotional arousability), the greater the left DLPFC-PCC connectivity was indicated, the greater the instability of the intrinsic rsFC was shown.", "publication_location": "Sheng Wu Yi Xue Gong Cheng Xue Za Zhi = Journal of Biomedical Engineering = Shengwu Yixue Gongchengxue Zazhi", "link": "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/25039124", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Purpose: To determine whether domain transfer learning can improve the performance of deep features extracted from digital mammograms using a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) in the prediction of occult invasive disease for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) on core needle biopsy. Method: In this study, we collected digital mammography magnification views for 140 patients with DCIS at biopsy, 35 of which were subsequently upstaged to invasive cancer. We utilized a deep CNN model that was pre-trained on two natural image data sets (ImageNet and DTD) and one mammographic data set (INbreast) as the feature extractor, hypothesizing that these data sets are increasingly more similar to our target task and will lead to better representations of deep features to describe DCIS lesions. Through a statistical pooling strategy, three sets of deep features were extracted using the CNNs at different levels of convolutional layers from the lesion areas. A logistic regression classifier was then trained to predict which tumors contain occult invasive disease. The generalization performance was assessed and compared using repeated random sub-sampling validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Result: The best performance of deep features was from CNN model pre-trained on INbreast, and the proposed classifier using this set of deep features was able to achieve a median classification performance of ROC-AUC equal to 0.75, which is significantly better (p<=0.05) than the performance of deep features extracted using ImageNet data set (ROCAUC = 0.68). Conclusion: Transfer learning is helpful for learning a better representation of deep features, and improves the prediction of occult invasive disease in DCIS.", "publication_location": "Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging   Proceedings of Spie", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2293594", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Autoencoders are popular among neural-network-based matrix completion models due to their ability to retrieve potential latent factors from the partially observed matrices.

Specifically, we propose an autoencoder-based matrix completion model that performs prediction of the unknown matrix values as a main task, and manifold learning as an auxiliary task. The latter acts as an inductive bias, leading to solutions that generalize better.

The disease is particularly prevalent in Asia, with up to 50% of total glaucoma cases found in the region. Although glaucomatous damage is irreversible, studies have shown that early detection can be effective in slowing or halting glaucomatous atrophy. The ratio of the size of the optic cup to the optic disc, also known as the cup-to-disc ratio (CDR), is an important indicator for glaucoma assessment, since glaucomatous progression corresponds to increased excavation of the optic cup. In current clinical practice, the CDR is measured manually and can be subjective, limiting its use in screening for early detection. We describe the ARGALI system which automatically calculates the CDR from non-stereographic retinal fundus photographs, providing a fast, objective and consistent measurement. The ARGALI system consists of a series of steps. As the optic disc occupies only a small region of the entire retinal image, a region of interest is first extracted via pixel intensity analysis. Variational level-set algorithm is next used to segment the optic disc. Optic cup segmentation is more challenging due to the cup's interweavement with blood vessels and surrounding tissues. A multi-modal approach consisting of different methods is used extract the cup. To obtain a smoother contour, ellipse fitting is applied to the extracted cup and disc. A neural network has also been proposed to fuse the results obtained via the various modes. The ARGALI system was tested using images collected from patients at the Singapore Eye Research Institute and achieves an RMS error of 0.05 with a risk assessment accuracy of 95%.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A DLA using a convolutional neural network was developed for automated detection of vision-threatening referable DR (preproliferative DR or worse, diabetic macular edema, or both). The DLA was tested by using a set of 106,244 nonstereoscopic retinal images. A panel of ophthalmologists graded DR severity in retinal photographs included in the development and internal validation data sets (n = 71,043); a reference standard grading was assigned once three graders achieved consistent grading outcomes. For external validation, we tested our DLA using 35,201 images of 14,520 eyes (904 eyes with any DR; 401 eyes with vision-threatening referable DR) from population-based cohorts of Malays, Caucasian Australians, and Indigenous Australians. RESULTS: Among the 71,043 retinal images in the training and validation data sets, 12,329 showed vision-threatening referable DR. In the internal validation data set, the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of the DLA for vision-threatening referable DR were 0.989, 97.0%, and 91.4%, respectively. Testing against the independent, multiethnic data set achieved an AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.955, 92.5%, and 98.5%, respectively. Among false-positive cases, 85.6% were due to a misclassification of mild or moderate DR. Undetected intraretinal microvascular abnormalities accounted for 77.3% of all false-negative cases.

This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using a novel distance-based representation of 3D CT-scan images to train a deep learning model for dose predictions in radiation treatment planning. The distance representation is inspired by previous knowledge of the domain to increase the generalizability of the deep learning models for radiation treatment planning. Conventional knowledge-based planning methods extract engineered features from 3D CT-scan images, as well as other patients' features, to predict the best achievable dose in a cancerous area and other organs at risk. Recent studies have shown higher accuracy in voxel-level dose prediction using deep learning models compared to the conventional machine learning approaches. Since the data resources for training these models are limited, most of the studies use 2D contour information to represent the patient anatomy. This representation loses volumetric information, and it is sensitive to small changes in patient orientation and translation. The distance-based representation introduced in this paper is inspired by the domain knowledge and is able to maintain the volumetric distance information despite the 2D slicing of 3D CT-image. According to prior studies in the radiation treatment planning domain, there is a strong association between the organs-at-risk distance from the cancerous volume and the patient's vulnerability to receive excessive dose. Therefore, the contour value in prior representation was replaced by voxel distance from cancerous volume. This modification in representation makes it transition and orientation invariant and adds potential robustness to patient positioning differences during the imaging/planning process. We evaluated the distance-based deep learning models through experiments for prediction of prostate cancer patients' vulnerability and voxel-level dose distribution using convolutional neural network and U-net models, respectively. The results were compared with contour-based U-net model as well as conventional machine learning with engineered representations. We found that the performance was comparable or higher than the prior state-of-the-art results for prostate-cancer dose distribution prediction.", "publication_location": "Proceedings   2019 Ieee International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine, Bibm 2019", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BIBM47256.2019.8983412", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": "3", "news_mentions": " "},

In this paper, symmetric residual convolutional neural network (SR-CNN), a deep learning based model, was proposed to enhance the sharpness of edges and detailed anatomical structures in under-sampled cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). For training, CBCT images were reconstructed using TV-based method from limited projections simulated from the ground truth CT, and were fed into SR-CNN, which was trained to learn a restoring pattern from under-sampled images to the ground truth. For testing, under-sampled CBCT was reconstructed using TV regularization and was then augmented by SR-CNN. Performance of SR-CNN was evaluated using phantom and patient images of various disease sites acquired at different institutions both qualitatively and quantitatively using structure similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). SR-CNN substantially enhanced image details in the TV-based CBCT across all experiments. In the patient study using real projections, SR-CNN augmented CBCT images reconstructed from as low as 120 half-fan projections to image quality comparable to the reference fully-sampled FDK reconstruction using 900 projections. In the tumor localization study, improvements in the tumor localization accuracy were made by the SR-CNN augmented images compared with the conventional FDK and TV-based images. SR-CNN demonstrated robustness against noise levels and projection number reductions and generalization for various disease sites and datasets from different institutions.

Then, to verify its capability to interpolate internal target motion with real‐time patient surface motion information. Methods and Materials: At discrete phases of a respiration cycle, the coordinates of points in a grid with specific interval on patient surface and internal target were automatically extracted from 4DCT data, then used for the experiments. A radial basis function (RBF) based neural network was employed for modeling purpose. The model was examined by eight sets of data, which consists of the coordinates of points on a patient surface and a region of interest (ROI) on either the left lung or right lung. Results: With fine sampling (grid interval < 5 voxels) of the patient surface and internal target, less than 5% interpolation error was found in seven experiments. one patient (right side of left lung) with error more than 8% and unexpected displacement more than 10 mm in 4DCT was observed. Coarse sampling (grid interval >10 voxels) will result in a larger interpolation error. In seven successful cases, the interpolation errors less than 2mm. The only failed one had interpolation error of 4 mm. Conclusion: A dynamic model is established for correlating patient surface motion with internal target motion based on 4DCT data. An acceptable interpolation accuracy is achieved for 7 of 8 cases examined in this study. The only failed one implied that for target motion with larger displacement and higher frequency, the model based on 4DCT data might be not sufficient because of its limited time resolution in acquiring those information in a respiration cycle. © 2006, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Recently, progress has been made in the supervised training of Convolutional Object Detectors (e.g. Faster R-CNN) for threat recognition in carry-on luggage using X-ray images. This is part of the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA's) mission to ensure safety for air travelers in the United States. Collecting more data reliably improves performance for this class of deep algorithm, but requires time and money to produce training data with threats staged in realistic contexts. In contrast to these hand-collected data containing threats, data from the real-world, known as the Stream-of-Commerce (SOC), can be collected quickly with minimal cost; while technically unlabeled, in this work we make a practical assumption that these are without threat objects. Because of these data constraints, we will use both labeled and unlabeled sources of data for the automatic threat recognition problem. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised approach for this problem which we call Background Adaptive Faster R-CNN. This approach is a training method for two-stage object detectors which uses Domain Adaptation methods from the field of deep learning. The data sources described earlier are considered two “domains”: one a hand-collected data domain of images with threats, and the other a real-world domain of images assumed without threats. Two domain discriminators, one for discriminating object proposals and one for image features, are adversarially trained to prevent encoding domain-specific information. Penalizing this encoding is important because otherwise the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can learn to distinguish images from the two sources based on superficial characteristics, and minimize a purely supervised loss function without improving its ability to recognize objects. For the hand-collected data, only object proposals and image features completely outside of areas corresponding to ground truth object bounding boxes (background) are used. The losses for these domain-adaptive discriminators are added to the Faster R-CNN losses of images from both domains. This technique enables threat recognition based on examples from the labeled data, and can reduce false alarm rates by matching the statistics of extracted features on the hand-collected backgrounds to that of the real world data. Performance improvements are demonstrated on two independently-collected datasets of labeled threats.", "publication_location": "Smart Structures and Materials 2005: Active Materials: Behavior and Mechanics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2558542", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Traditional algorithms for UXO remediation experience severe difficulty distinguishing buried targets from anthropic clutter. Furthermore, naturally occurring magnetic geologic noise often adds to the complexity of the discrimination task. These problems render site remediation a very slow, labor-intensive, and inefficient process. While sensors have improved significantly over the past several years in their ability to detect conducting and/or permeable targets, reduction of the false alarm rate has proven to be a significantly more challenging problem. Our work has focused on the development of signal processing algorithms that incorporate the underlying physics characteristic of the sensor and of the anticipated UXO target, in order to address the false alarm issue. In this paper, we describe several algorithms for discriminating targets from clutter that have been applied to data obtained with the multisensor towed array detection system (MTADS). This sensor suite has been developed by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), and includes both electromagnetic induction (EMI) and magnetometer sensors. We describe four signal processing techniques that incorporate features derived from simple physics-based sensor models: a generalized likelihood ratio technique, a maximum likelihood estimation-based clustering algorithm, a probabilistic neural network, and a subtractive fuzzy clustering technique. These algorithms have been applied to the data measured by MTADS in a magnetically clean test pit and at a field demonstration. We show that overall the subtractive fuzzy technique performs better than the alternative techniques when the training and testing data sets are separate. The results also allow us to quantify the utility of fusing the magnetometer and the EMI data, and we show that performance is improved when both EMI and magnetometer features are utilized.

Identifying smoking risk environments from images of a smoker's daily life provides a basis for environment-based interventions. Objective: To apply a deep learning approach to the clinically relevant identification of smoking environments among settings that smokers encounter in daily life. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, 4902 images of smoking (n = 2457) and nonsmoking (n = 2445) locations were photographed by 169 smokers from Durham, North Carolina, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, areas from 2010 to 2016. These images were used to develop a probabilistic classifier to predict the location type (smoking or nonsmoking location), thus relating objects and settings in daily environments to established smoking patterns. The classifier combines a deep convolutional neural network with an interpretable logistic regression model and was trained and evaluated via nested cross-validation with participant-wise partitions (ie, out-of-sample prediction). To contextualize model performance, images taken by 25 randomly selected participants were also classified by smoking cessation experts. As secondary validation, craving levels reported by participants when viewing unfamiliar environments were compared with the model's predictions. Data analysis was performed from September 2017 to May 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Classifier performance (accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]), comparison with 4 smoking cessation experts, contribution of objects and settings to smoking environment status (standardized model coefficients), and correlation with participant-reported craving. Results: Of 169 participants, 106 (62.7%) were from Durham (53 [50.0%] female; mean [SD] age, 41.4 [12.0] years) and 63 (37.3%) were from Pittsburgh (31 [51.7%] female; mean [SD] age, 35.2 [13.8] years). A total of 4902 images were available for analysis, including 3386 from Durham (mean [SD], 31.9 [1.3] images per participant) and 1516 from Pittsburgh (mean [SD], 24.1 [0.5] images per participant). Images were evenly split between the 2 classes, with 2457 smoking images (50.1%) and 2445 nonsmoking images (49.9%). The final model discriminated smoking vs nonsmoking environments with a mean (SD) AUC of 0.840 (0.024) (accuracy [SD], 76.5% [1.6%]). A model trained only with images from Durham participants effectively classified images from Pittsburgh participants (AUC, 0.757; accuracy, 69.2%), and a model trained only with images from Pittsburgh participants effectively classified images from Durham participants (AUC, 0.821; accuracy, 75.0%), suggesting good generalizability between geographic areas. Only 1 expert's performance was a statistically significant improvement compared with the classifier (α = .05). Median self-reported craving was significantly correlated with model-predicted smoking environment status (ρ = 0.894; P = .003). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, features of daily environments predicted smoking vs nonsmoking status consistently across participants. The findings suggest that a deep learning approach can identify environments associated with smoking, can predict the probability that any image of daily life represents a smoking environment, and can potentially trigger environment-based interventions. This work demonstrates a framework for predicting how daily environments may influence target behaviors or symptoms that may have broad applications in mental and physical health.", "publication_location": "Jama Network Open", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.7939", "citations": "1", "readership": "12", "tweets": "19", "news_mentions": " "},

Noteworthy applications include weather states as described by weather variables over a region and speech patterns as characterized by frequencies in time. The SOM approach is essentially a neural network model that implements a nonlinear projection from a high-dimensional input space to a low-dimensional array of neurons. In the process, it also becomes a clustering technique, assigning to any vector in the high-dimensional data space the node (neuron) to which it is closest (using, say, Euclidean distance) in the data space. The number of nodes is thus equal to the number of clusters. However, the primary use for the SOM is as a representation technique, that is, finding a set of nodes which representatively span the high-dimensional space. These nodes are typically displayed using maps to enable visualization of the continuum of the data space. The technique does not appear to have been discussed in the statistics literature so it is our intent here to bring it to the attention of the community. The technique is implemented algorithmically through a training set of vectors. However, through the introduction of stochasticity in the form of a space-time process model, we seek to illuminate and interpret its performance in the context of application to daily data collection. That is, the observed daily state vectors are viewed as a time series of multivariate process realizations which we try to understand under the dimension reduction achieved by the SOM procedure. The application we focus on here is to synoptic climatology where the goal is to develop an array of atmospheric states to capture a collection of distinct circulation patterns. In particular, we have daily weather data observed in the form of 11 variables measured for each of 77 grid cells yielding an 847×1 vector for each day. We have such daily vectors for a period of 31 years (11,315 days). Twelve SOM nodes have been obtained by the meteorologists to represent the space of these data vectors.

We aimed to generate and validate a risk tool that predicts adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS:Using logistic regression models, we generated a risk tool in a representative population cohort (ALSPAC - UK, 5113 participants, followed from birth to age 17) using childhood clinical and sociodemographic data with internal validation. Predictors included sex, socioeconomic status, single-parent family, ADHD symptoms, comorbid disruptive disorders, childhood maltreatment, ADHD symptoms, depressive symptoms, mother's depression and intelligence quotient. The outcome was defined as a categorical diagnosis of ADHD in young adulthood without requiring age at onset criteria. We also tested Machine Learning approaches for developing the risk models: Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting and Artificial Neural Network. The risk tool was externally validated in the E-Risk cohort (UK, 2040 participants, birth to age 18), the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort (Brazil, 3911 participants, birth to age 18) and the MTA clinical sample (USA, 476 children with ADHD and 241 controls followed for 16 years from a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 26 years old). RESULTS:The overall prevalence of adult ADHD ranged from 8.1 to 12% in the population-based samples, and was 28.6% in the clinical sample. The internal performance of the model in the generating sample was good, with an area under the curve (AUC) for predicting adult ADHD of 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.83). Calibration plots showed good agreement between predicted and observed event frequencies from 0 to 60% probability. In the UK birth cohort test sample, the AUC was 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0.78). In the Brazilian birth cohort test sample, the AUC was significantly lower -0.57 (95% CI 0.54-0.60). In the clinical trial test sample, the AUC was 0.76 (95% CI 0.73-0.80). The risk model did not predict adult anxiety or major depressive disorder. Machine Learning approaches did not outperform logistic regression models. An open-source and free risk calculator was generated for clinical use and is available online at https://ufrgs.br/prodah/adhd-calculator/. CONCLUSIONS:The risk tool based on childhood characteristics specifically predicts adult ADHD in European and North-American population-based and clinical samples with comparable discrimination to commonly used clinical tools in internal medicine and higher than most previous attempts for mental and neurological disorders.

An automatic method that can predict whether a patient is likely to respond to anti-VEGF therapy can avoid unnecessary trial and error treatment strategies and promote the selection of more effective first-line therapies. The objective of this study is to automatically predict the efficacy of anti-VEGF treatment of DME in individual patients based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. We performed a retrospective study of 127 subjects treated for DME with three consecutive injections of anti-VEGF agents. Patients' retinas were imaged using spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) before and after anti-VEGF therapy, and the total retinal thicknesses before and after treatment were extracted from OCT B-scans. A novel deep convolutional neural network was designed and evaluated using pre-treatment OCT scans as input and differential retinal thickness as output, with 5-fold cross-validation. The group of patients responsive to anti-VEGF treatment was defined as those with at least a 10% reduction in retinal thickness following treatment. The predictive performance of the system was evaluated by calculating the precision, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The algorithm achieved an average AUC of 0.866 in discriminating responsive from non-responsive patients, with an average precision, sensitivity, and specificity of 85.5%, 80.1%, and 85.0%, respectively. Classification precision was significantly higher when differentiating between very responsive and very unresponsive patients. The proposed automatic algorithm accurately predicts the response to anti-VEGF treatment in DME patients based on OCT images.

We found that C. elegans mutants in G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in the nervous system exhibit aberrant responses to pathogen infection. The use of different pathogens, different modes of infection and genome-wide microarrays highlighted the importance of the GPCR NPR-1 in avoidance to certain pathogens and in the regulation of innate immunity.

We found that the judgment of moral wrongness was subserved by distinct neural systems for each of the different moral areas and that these differences were much more robust than differences in wrongness judgments within a moral area. Dishonest, disgusting, and harmful moral transgression recruited networks of brain regions associated with mentalizing, affective processing, and action understanding, respectively. Dorsal medial pFC was the only region activated by all scenarios judged to be morally wrong in comparison with neutral scenarios. However, this region was also activated by dishonest and harmful scenarios judged not to be morally wrong, suggestive of a domain-general role that is neither peculiar to nor predictive of moral decisions.

However, little is known about how, where and when neural subtypes are differentially specified during development. Here, we examine the molecular mechanisms of neuronal subtype specification in 3 distinct neural subtypes in the Lytechinus variegatus larva. We show that these subtypes are specified through Delta/Notch signaling and identify a different transcription factor required for the development of each neural subtype. Our results show achaete-scute and neurogenin are proneural for the serotonergic neurons of the apical organ and cholinergic neurons of the ciliary band, respectively. We also show that orthopedia is not proneural but is necessary for the differentiation of the cholinergic/catecholaminergic postoral neurons.

It is unclear, however, whether these two forms of salience interact with attentional networks through similar or different neural mechanisms, and what such differences might be. We examined this question by separately manipulating both the value-driven and physical salience of targets in a visual search task while recording response times (RTs) and event-related potentials, focusing on the attentional-orienting-sensitive N2pc event-related potential component. Human participants of both sexes searched arrays for targets of either a high-physical-salience color or one of two low-physical-salience colors across three experimental phases. The first phase (\"baseline\") offered no rewards. RT and N2pc latencies were shorter for high-physical-salience targets, indicating faster attentional orienting. In the second phase (\"equal-reward\"), a low monetary reward was given for fast correct responses for all target types. This reward context improved overall performance, similarly shortening RTs and enhancing N2pc amplitudes for all target types, but with no change in N2pc latencies. In the third phase (\"selective-reward\"), the reward rate was made selectively higher for one of the two low-physical-salience colors, resulting in their RTs becoming as fast as the high-physical-salience targets. Despite the equally fast RTs, the N2pc's for these low-physical-salience, high-value targets remained later than for high-physical-salience targets, instead eliciting significantly larger N2pc's. These results suggest that enhanced physical salience leads to faster attentional orienting, but value-driven salience to stronger attentional orienting, underscoring the utilization of different underlying mechanisms.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Associating relevant target stimuli with reward value can enhance their salience, facilitating their attentional selection. This value-driven salience improves behavioral performance, similar to the effects of physical salience. Recent theories, however, suggest that these forms of salience are intrinsically different, although the neural mechanisms underlying any such differences remain unclear. This study addressed this issue by manipulating the physical and value-related salience of targets in a visual search task, comparing their effects on several attention-sensitive neural-activity measures. Our findings show that, whereas physical salience accelerates the speed of attentional selection, value-driven salience selectively enhances its strength.

In this study we investigated changes in neural oscillation during the resting-state of patients with anxious depression by measuring differences in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF). METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in 31 patients with anxious depression, 18 patients with remitted depression, as well as 68 gender- and age-matched healthy participants. We compared the differences both in the ALFF and fractional ALFF (fALFF) among the three groups. We also examined the correlation between the ALFF/fALFF and the severity of anxiety as well as depression. RESULTS: Anxious depression patients showed increased ALFF/fALFF in the right dorsal anterior insular cortex and decreased ALFF/fALFF in the bilateral lingual gyrus relative to remitted depression patients and healthy controls. The increased ALFF in the dorsal anterior insula was also positively correlated with stronger anxiety in the anxious depression group. Anxious depression patients also displayed increased fALFF in the right ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) compared to remitted depression patients and healthy controls.

The study of the neural correlates of involuntary memories of stressful events in PTSD focuses on the voluntary retrieval of memories that are sometimes recalled as intrusive involuntary memories, not on involuntary retrieval while being scanned. Involuntary memory retrieval in controls has been shown to elicit activity in the parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, inferior parietal cortex, and posterior midline regions. However, it is unknown whether involuntary memories are supported by the same mechanisms in PTSD. Because previous work has shown that both behavioral and neural responsivity is slowed in PTSD, we examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of the neural activity underlying negative and neutral involuntary memory retrieval. Methods:Twenty-one individuals with PTSD and 21 non-PTSD, trauma-exposed controls performed an involuntary memory task, while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Environmental sounds served as cues for well-associated pictures of negative and neutral scenes. We used a finite impulse response model to analyze temporal differences between groups in neural responses. Results:Compared with controls, participants with PTSD reported more involuntary memories, which were more emotional and more vivid, but which activated a similar network of regions. However, compared to controls, individuals with PTSD showed delayed neural responsivity in this network and increased vmPFC/ACC activity for negative > neutral stimuli. Conclusions:The similarity between PTSD and controls in neural substrates underlying involuntary memories suggests that, unlike voluntary memories, involuntary memories elicit similar activity in regions critical for memory retrieval. Further, the delayed neural responsivity for involuntary memories in PTSD suggests that factors affecting cognition in PTSD, like increased fatigue, or avoidance behaviors could do so by delaying activity in regions necessary for cognitive processing. Finally, compared to neutral memories, negative involuntary memories elicit hyperactivity in the vmPFC, whereas the vmPFC is typically shown to be hypoactive in PTSD during voluntary memory retrieval. These patterns suggest that considering both the temporal dynamics of cognitive processes as well as involuntary cognitive processes would improve existing neurobiological models of PTSD.", "publication_location": " ", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2018.05.009", "citations": "9", "readership": "53", "tweets": "15", "news_mentions": " "},

How do long-term memory mechanisms balance the need to represent potential determinants of reward outcomes with the computational burden of an over-inclusive memory? One solution would be to enhance memory for salient events that occur during reward anticipation, because all such events are potential determinants of reward. We tested whether reward motivation enhances encoding of salient events like expectancy violations. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants performed a reaction-time task in which goal-irrelevant expectancy violations were encountered during states of high- or low-reward motivation. Motivation amplified hippocampal activation to and declarative memory for expectancy violations. Connectivity of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) with medial prefrontal, ventrolateral prefrontal, and visual cortices preceded and predicted this increase in hippocampal sensitivity. These findings elucidate a novel mechanism whereby reward motivation can enhance hippocampus-dependent memory: anticipatory VTA-cortical-hippocampal interactions. Further, the findings integrate literatures on dopaminergic neuromodulation of prefrontal function and hippocampus-dependent memory. We conclude that during reward motivation, VTA modulation induces distributed neural changes that amplify hippocampal signals and records of expectancy violations to improve predictions-a potentially unique contribution of the hippocampus to reward learning.", "publication_location": "Cerebral Cortex", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bht063", "citations": "72", "readership": "165", "tweets": "4", "news_mentions": "4"},

Recent findings from a multi-tissue study demonstrated high expression of many of the same gene networks between blood and brain tissues, in particular with cell cycle functions. We explored relationships between blood gene expression and total brain volume (TBV) in 142 ASD and control male toddlers. In control toddlers, TBV variation significantly correlated with cell cycle and protein folding gene networks, potentially impacting neuron number and synapse development. In ASD toddlers, their correlations with brain size were lost as a result of considerable changes in network organization, while cell adhesion gene networks significantly correlated with TBV variation. Cell cycle networks detected in blood are highly preserved in the human brain and are upregulated during prenatal states of development. Overall, alterations were more pronounced in bigger brains. We identified 23 candidate genes for brain maldevelopment linked to 32 genes frequently mutated in ASD. The integrated network includes genes that are dysregulated in leukocyte and/or postmortem brain tissue of ASD subjects and belong to signaling pathways regulating cell cycle G1/S and G2/M phase transition.

The song motor circuit includes premotor and motor cortical analogs, known as HVC (used as a proper name) and RA (the robust nucleus of the arcopallium), respectively. Previous studies showed that HVC projects to RA and that RA projection neurons (PNs) topographically innervate brainstem vocal-motor and respiratory networks. The idea that singing-related activity flows between HVC and RA in a strictly feedforward manner is a central component of all models of song production. In contrast to this prevailing view of song motor circuit organization, we show that RA sends a reciprocal projection directly to HVC. Lentiviral labeling of RA PN axons and transgene tagging of RA PN synaptic terminals reveal a direct projection from RA to HVC. Retrograde tracing from HVC demonstrates that this projection originates exclusively from neurons in dorsocaudal regions of RA. Using dual retrograde tracer injections, we further show that many of these RA(HVC) neurons also innervate the brainstem nucleus retroambigualis, which is premotor to expiratory motoneurons, thereby identifying a population of RA PNs positioned to coordinate activity at higher and lower levels of the song motor circuit. In combination, our findings identify a previously unknown pathway that may enable a subset of RA neurons to provide song-related signals to the respiratory brainstem but also transmit a copy of this information to song patterning networks in HVC.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0177-08.2008", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The canonical explanation for this effect is that frames differentially modulate emotional processes, which in turn leads to irrational choice behavior. Here, we evaluate the source of framing biases by integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 143 human participants performing a gain/loss framing task with meta-analytic data from >8000 neuroimaging studies. We found that activation during choices consistent with the framing effect were most correlated with activation associated with the resting or default brain, while activation during choices inconsistent with the framing effect was most correlated with the task-engaged brain. Our findings argue against the common interpretation of gain/loss framing as a competition between emotion and control. Instead, our study indicates that this effect results from differential cognitive engagement across decision frames.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The biases frequently exhibited by human decision makers have often been attributed to the presence of emotion. Using a large fMRI sample and analysis of whole-brain networks defined with the meta-analytic tool Neurosynth, we find that neural activity during frame-biased decisions was more significantly associated with default behaviors (and the absence of executive control) than with emotion.

Multiple organizational schemes based on anatomy and function have been proposed for dopaminergic nuclei in the midbrain. One schema originating in rodent models delineated ventral tegmental area (VTA), implicated in complex behaviors like addiction, from more lateral substantia nigra (SN), preferentially implicated in movement. However, because anatomy and function in rodent midbrain differs from the primate midbrain in important ways, the utility of this distinction for human neuroscience has been questioned. We asked whether functional definition of networks within the human dopaminergic midbrain would recapitulate this traditional anatomical topology. We first developed a method for reliably defining SN and VTA in humans at conventional MRI resolution. Hand-drawn VTA and SN regions-of-interest (ROIs) were constructed for 50 participants, using individually-localized anatomical landmarks and signal intensity. Individual segmentation was used in seed-based functional connectivity analysis of resting-state functional MRI data; results of this analysis recapitulated traditional anatomical targets of the VTA versus SN. Next, we constructed a probabilistic atlas of the VTA, SN, and the dopaminergic midbrain region (comprised of SN plus VTA) from individual hand-drawn ROIs. The combined probabilistic (SN plus VTA) ROI was then used for connectivity-based dual-regression analysis in two independent resting-state datasets (n = 69 and n = 79). Results of the connectivity-based, dual-regression functional segmentation recapitulated results of the anatomical segmentation, validating the utility of this probabilistic atlas for future research.", "publication_location": "Neuroimage", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.06.047", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

For each subject and scan, whole-brain tractography was used to estimate connectivity between 113 cortical and subcortical regions. We examined how scanner field strength affects (i) the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the non-diffusion-sensitized reference images (b(0)); (ii) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived fractional anisotropy (FA), mean, radial, and axial diffusivity (MD/RD/AD), in atlas-defined regions; (iii) whole-brain tractography; (iv) the 113 × 113 brain connectivity maps; and (v) five commonly used network topology measures.

FA was similar for most regions of interest (ROIs) derived from an online DTI atlas (ICBM81), but higher at 7T in the cerebral peduncle and internal capsule.

Our goal was to study how trauma-related environmental cues modulate working memory networks in PTSD. We examined neural activity in participants performing a visual working memory task while distracted by task-irrelevant trauma and non-trauma material. Recent post-9/11 veterans were divided into a PTSD group (n=22) and a trauma-exposed control group (n=20) based on the Davidson trauma scale. Using fMRI, we measured hemodynamic change in response to emotional (trauma-related) and neutral distraction presented during the active maintenance period of a delayed-response working memory task. The goal was to examine differences in functional networks associated with working memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and lateral parietal cortex) and emotion processing (amygdala, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and fusiform gyrus). The PTSD group showed markedly different neural activity compared to the trauma-exposed control group in response to task-irrelevant visual distractors. Enhanced activity in ventral emotion processing regions was associated with trauma distractors in the PTSD group, whereas activity in brain regions associated with working memory and attention regions was disrupted by distractor stimuli independent of trauma content.

Healthy volunteers were cued to locations defined in either viewer-centered or object-centered space to discriminate the shape of visual targets subsequently presented at the cued locations. Brain responses to attention-directing cues were quantified using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. A fronto-parietal control network was activated by attention-directing cues in both reference frames. Voluntary shifts of attention produced increased neural activity bilaterally in several cortical regions including the intraparietal sulcus, anterior cingulate cortex, and the frontal eye fields. Of special interest was the observation of hemispheric asymmetries in parietal cortex; there was significantly greater activity in left parietal cortex than in the right, but this asymmetry was more pronounced for object-centered shifts of attention, relative to viewer-centered shifts of attention.

We tested 12 combinations of cycling on/off times that maintained the same average frequency of 125 Hz, four constant frequency settings, and baseline.Tremor and neural firing pattern entropy decreased as the percent on time increased from 50% to 100%. Cycling with stimulation on for at least 60% of the time was as effective as regular stimulation. All cycling settings reduced the firing pattern entropy of model neurons from the no stimulation condition by regularizing pathological firing patterns, either through synaptically-mediated inhibition or axon excitation.These results indicate that pauses present in cycling stimulation decreased its effectiveness in suppressing tremor, and that changes in the amount of tremor suppression were strongly correlated with changes in the firing pattern entropy of model neurons.Cycling stimulation may reduce power consumption during clinical DBS, and thereby increase the battery life of the implanted pulse generator.", "publication_location": "Clinical Neurophysiology : Official Journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2011.07.052", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

In this task, two versions of the same picture are presented in alternation, separated by a brief mask interval. Even when the two pictures greatly differ (e.g., as when a building is in different locations), subjects report that identification of the change is difficult and often take 30 or more seconds to identify the change. This phenomenon of \"change blindness\" provides a powerful and novel paradigm for segregating components of visual attention using fMRI that can otherwise be confounded in short-duration tasks. By using a response-contingent event-related analysis technique, we successfully dissociated brain regions associated with different processing components of a visual change-detection task. Activation in the calcarine cortex was associated with task onset, but did not vary with the duration of visual search. In contrast, the pattern of activation in dorsal and ventral visual areas was temporally associated with the duration of visual search. As such, our results support a distinction between brain regions whose activation is modulated by attentional demands of the visual task (extrastriate cortex) and those that are not affected by it (primary visual cortex). A second network of areas including central sulcus, insular, and inferior frontal cortical areas, along with the thalamus and basal ganglia, showed phasic activation tied to the execution of responses. Finally, parietal and frontal regions showed systematic deactivations during task performance, consistent with previous reports that these regions may be associated with nontask semantic processing. We conclude that detection of change, when transient visual cues are not present, requires activation of extrastriate visual regions and frontal regions responsible for eye movements. These results suggest that studies of change blindness can inform understanding of more general attentional processing.", "publication_location": "Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/089892901753165908", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Evidence from diverse experimental approaches has linked this function to a mostly right-lateralized network of cortical and subcortical areas, wherein a signal from the frontal cortex to the basal ganglia is believed to trigger motor-response cancellation. Recently, however, it has been recognized that in the context of typical motor-control paradigms those processes related to actual response inhibition and those related to the attentional processing of the relevant stimuli are highly interrelated and thus difficult to distinguish. Here, we used fMRI and a modified Stop-signal task to specifically examine the role of perceptual and attentional processes triggered by the different stimuli in such tasks, thus seeking to further distinguish other cognitive processes that may precede or otherwise accompany the implementation of response inhibition. In order to establish which brain areas respond to sensory stimulation differences by rare Stop-stimuli, as well as to the associated attentional capture that these may trigger irrespective of their task-relevance, we compared brain activity evoked by Stop-trials to that evoked by Go-trials in task blocks where Stop-stimuli were to be ignored. In addition, region-of-interest analyses comparing the responses to these task-irrelevant Stop-trials, with those to typical relevant Stop-trials, identified separable activity profiles as a function of the task-relevance of the Stop-signal. While occipital areas were mostly blind to the task-relevance of Stop-stimuli, activity in temporo-parietal areas dissociated between task-irrelevant and task-relevant ones. Activity profiles in frontal areas, in turn, were activated mainly by task-relevant Stop-trials, presumably reflecting a combination of triggered top-down attentional influences and inhibitory motor-control processes.", "publication_location": "Plos One", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0026386", "citations": "29", "readership": "90", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The authors investigated whether childhood experience of abuse (e.g. physical, emotional and sexual abuse) and neglect (physical and emotional deprivation) was differentially associated with neural reactivity to threat. METHODS:Participants were drawn from an existing study and allocated to one of four groups based on self-report of childhood maltreatment experience: individuals with childhood abuse experiences (n = 70); individuals with childhood neglect experiences (n = 87); individuals with combined experience of childhood abuse and neglect (n = 50); and non-maltreated individuals (n = 207) propensity score matched (PSM) on gender, age, IQ, psychopathology and SES. Neural reactivity to facial cues signalling threat was compared across groups, allowing the differential effects associated with particular forms of maltreatment experience to be isolated. RESULTS:Brain imaging analyses indicated that while childhood abuse was associated with heightened localised threat reactivity in ventral amygdala, experiences of neglect were associated with heightened reactivity in a distributed cortical fronto-parietal network supporting complex social and cognitive processing as well as in the dorsal amygdala. Unexpectedly, combined experiences of abuse and neglect were associated with hypo-activation in several higher-order cortical regions as well as the amygdala. CONCLUSIONS:Different forms of childhood maltreatment exert differential effects in neural threat reactivity: while the effects of abuse are more focal, the effects of neglect and combined experiences of abuse are more distributed.

Prioritized processing of affective stimulus content may enhance accessibility of affective task-sets and generate increased interference when switching between affective and non-affective task-sets. Previous research has demonstrated that more dominant task-sets experience greater switch costs, as they necessitate active inhibition during performance of less entrenched tasks. Extending this logic to the affective domain, the present experiment examined (a) whether affective task-sets are more dominant than non-affective ones, and (b) what neural mechanisms regulate affective task-sets, so that weaker, non-affective task-sets can be executed. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants categorized face stimuli according to either their gender (non-affective task) or their emotional expression (affective task). Behavioral results were consistent with the affective task dominance hypothesis: participants were slower to switch to the affective task, and cross-task interference was strongest when participants tried to switch from the affective to the non-affective task. These behavioral costs of controlling the affective task-set were mirrored in the activation of a right-lateralized frontostriatal network previously implicated in task-set updating and response inhibition.

Functional neuroimaging can contribute to both of these goals. Using image subtraction analysis of regional cerebral blood flow data measured with positron emission tomography, we identified brain regions that changed activity during episodic memory retrieval (visual work recognition). Relative to a baseline reading task, decreased activity was observed in bilateral prefrontal, bilateral anterior and posterior temporal, and posterior cingulate cortices. Brain regions showing increased activity were the right prefrontal (different from deactivated regions), left anterior cingulate, and left occipital cortices, and vermis of cerebellum. We then performed a network analysis with structural equation modeling to test the hypothesis that regional decreases came about through active inhibition by regions showing increased activity during retrieval. This analysis demonstrated that the influence of activated regions on deactivated regions was more negative during retrieval than during reading, confirming the inhibition hypothesis. Such confirmation could not have been made from the subtraction analysis alone because decreases can come about, at the very least, through reduction of functional influences as well as by active inhibition.

To investigate these issues, the current fMRI study measured activity during retrieval of memories that differed quantitatively in terms of strength (high vs. low-confidence trials) and qualitatively in terms of recollection versus familiarity (source vs. item memory tasks). Support for each theory varied depending on which node of the episodic memory network was considered. Results from MTL best fit a dual-process account, as a dissociation was found between a right hippocampal region showing high-confidence activity during the source memory task and bilateral rhinal regions showing high-confidence activity during the item memory task. Within PFC, several left-lateralized regions showed greater activity for source than item memory, consistent with recollective orienting, whereas a right-lateralized ventrolateral area showed low-confidence activity in both tasks, consistent with monitoring processes. Parietal findings were generally consistent with strength theory, with dorsal areas showing low-confidence activity and ventral areas showing high-confidence activity in both tasks. This dissociation fits with an attentional account of parietal functions during episodic retrieval. The results suggest that both dual-process and strength theories are partly correct, highlighting the need for an integrated model that links to more general cognitive theories to account for observed neural activity during episodic memory retrieval.", "publication_location": "Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_00086", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Prior neuroimaging studies suggest that hallucinations are linked to disrupted communication across distributed (sensory, salience-monitoring and subcortical) networks. Yet, our understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie auditory and visual hallucinations in schizophrenia remains limited. This study integrates two resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis methods - amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and functional network connectivity (FNC) - to explore the hypotheses that (1) abnormal FNC between salience and sensory (visual/auditory) networks underlies hallucinations in schizophrenia, and (2) disrupted hippocampal oscillations (as measured by hippocampal ALFF) beget changes in FNC linked to hallucinations. Our first hypothesis was supported by the finding that schizophrenia patients reporting hallucinations have higher FNC between the salience network and an associative auditory network relative to healthy controls. Hippocampal ALFF was negatively associated with FNC between primary auditory cortex and the salience network in healthy subjects, but was positively associated with FNC between these networks in patients reporting hallucinations. These findings provide indirect support favoring our second hypothesis.

Resting state-fMRI data were obtained from 12 healthy control subjects and 15 children with ADHD, all who had a minimum one-month washout period for medications and supplements. Children with ADHD demonstrated less integrated affective network, evidenced by increased bilateral amygdalar and decreased left orbitofrontal connectivity within the affective network compared to healthy controls. The hyper-connectivity at the left amygdalar within the affective network was associated with increased aggressiveness and conduct problems, as well as decline in functioning in children with ADHD. Similar findings in affective network dysconnectivity were replicated in a subset of children with ADHD three months later. Our findings of divergent changes in amygdala and orbitofrontal intrinsic connectivity support the hypothesis of an impaired functional integration within the affective network in childhood ADHD.

To overcome this limitation, we propose an approach to evaluate network inference algorithms according to their ability to recover a complex functional network from biologically reasonable simulated data. RESULTS: We designed a simulator to generate data representing a complex biological system at multiple levels of organization: behaviour, neural anatomy, brain electrophysiology, and gene expression of songbirds. About 90% of the simulated variables are unregulated by other variables in the system and are included simply as distracters. We sampled the simulated data at intervals as one would sample from a biological system in practice, and then used the sampled data to evaluate the effectiveness of an algorithm we developed for functional network inference. We found that our algorithm is highly effective at recovering the functional network structure of the simulated system-including the irrelevance of unregulated variables-from sampled data alone. To assess the reproducibility of these results, we tested our inference algorithm on 50 separately simulated sets of data and it consistently recovered almost perfectly the complex functional network structure underlying the simulated data. To our knowledge, this is the first approach for evaluating the effectiveness of functional network inference algorithms at recovering models from limited data.

Given the availability of large scale data sets, it is extremely interesting and important to build a set of advanced tools for structural connectome extraction and statistical analysis that emphasize both interpretability and predictive power. In this paper, we developed and integrated a set of toolboxes, including an advanced structural connectome extraction pipeline and a novel tensor network principal components analysis (TN-PCA) method, to study relationships between structural connectomes and various human traits such as alcohol and drug use, cognition and motion abilities. The structural connectome extraction pipeline produces a set of connectome features for each subject that can be organized as a tensor network, and TN-PCA maps the high-dimensional tensor network data to a lower-dimensional Euclidean space. Combined with classical hypothesis testing, canonical correlation analysis and linear discriminant analysis techniques, we analyzed over 1100 scans of 1076 subjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Sherbrooke test-retest data set, as well as 175 human traits measuring different domains including cognition, substance use, motor, sensory and emotion. The test-retest data validated the developed algorithms. With the HCP data, we found that structural connectomes are associated with a wide range of traits, e.g., fluid intelligence, language comprehension, and motor skills are associated with increased cortical-cortical brain structural connectivity, while the use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana are associated with decreased cortical-cortical connectivity.

In a visual oddball task, aversive and neutral scenes were presented intermittently among circles and squares. The squares were frequent standard events, whereas the other novel stimulus categories occurred rarely. One experimental group [N=10] was instructed to count the circles, whereas another group [N=12] counted the emotional scenes.

A main effect of attentional focus was found in dorsal frontoparietal cortices, whose activity signaled task-relevant target events irrespective of emotional content. The only brain region that was sensitive to both emotion and attentional focus was the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG).

Between-hemisphere connectivity and graph theoretical methods were used to analyze the data. We found significantly reduced WM connectivity between the left and right hemisphere in the RGD group compared with the control group.

However, little is known about its neural underpinnings. Imaging studies have suggested that the brain's default network is involved with self-related processing and that one portion of the default network, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), is particularly involved with self-evaluation. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to causally demonstrate that this network, and particularly MPFC, is involved with self-evaluative processing. In a first experiment, 27 healthy volunteers judged whether adjectives, evenly divided between desirable and undesirable traits, described themselves or their best friends, and a robust self-enhancement bias effect was found. In a second experiment, single-pulse TMS was applied targeting three locations (MPFC and left and right parietal cortex) in a different group of healthy volunteers while they performed the adjective task. In each trial, TMS was applied at one of five different times relative to onset of the adjective ranging from 0 to 480 ms. TMS affected self-enhancement bias in a site- and latency-specific manner: at MPFC, the self-enhancement bias actually reversed at 160 ms, with subjects favoring their best friend over themselves.

However, criticism has arisen that this network may not be specific to self-related processing, but instead reflects a more general aspect of cortical processing. For example, it is almost identical to the active network of the resting state, the \"default\" mode, when the subject is free to think about anything at all. We tested the self-specificity of this network by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to briefly disrupt local cortical processing while subjects rated adjectives as like or unlike themselves or their best friend. Healthy volunteers show a self-reference effect (SRE) in this task, in which performance with self-related items is superior to that with other-related items. As individual adjectives appeared on a monitor, single-pulse TMS was applied at five different times relative to stimulus onset (SOA: stimulus onset asynchrony) ranging from 0 to 480 ms. In 18 subjects, TMS to left parietal cortex suppressed the SRE from 160 to 480 ms. SRE suppression occurred at later SOA with TMS to the right parietal cortex. In contrast, no effects were seen with TMS to MPFC.

To understand the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, it is essential to investigate how persistent activity is affected by external inputs or neuromodulation. We have addressed these questions using a recurrent network model of object working memory. Recurrence is dominated by inhibition, although persistent activity is generated through recurrent excitation in small subsets of excitatory neurons. Our main findings are as follows. (1) Because of the strong feedback inhibition, persistent activity shows an inverted U shape as a function of increased external drive to the network. (2) A transient external excitation can switch off a network from a selective persistent state to its spontaneous state. (3) The maintenance of the sample stimulus in working memory is not affected by intervening stimuli (distractors) during the delay period, provided the stimulation intensity is not large. On the other hand, if stimulation intensity is large enough, distractors disrupt sample-related persistent activity, and the network is able to maintain a memory only of the last shown stimulus. (4) A concerted modulation of GABA(A) and NMDA conductances leads to a decrease of spontaneous activity but an increase of persistent activity; the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio is shown to increase the resistance of the network to distractors. (5) Two mechanisms are identified that produce an inverted U shaped dependence of persistent activity on modulation. The present study therefore points to several mechanisms that enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in working memory states. These mechanisms could be implemented in the prefrontal cortex by dopaminergic projections from the midbrain.", "publication_location": "Journal of Computational Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1011204814320", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

In humans, this research has been primarily based on imaging and electroencephalography (EEG), and as such only correlational. One line of such research has led to a model of three spatially distributed brain networks that activate in temporal sequence to enable visual decision-making. The model predicted that disturbing neural processing in the LOC at a specific latency would slow object decision-making, increasing reaction time (RT) in a difficult discrimination task. We utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test this prediction, perturbing LOC beginning at 400 ms post-stimulus onset, a time in the model corresponding to LOC activation at a particular difficulty level, with the expectation of increased RT. Thirteen healthy adults participated in two TMS sessions in which left and right LOC were stimulated separately utilizing neuronavigation and robotic coil guidance. Participants performed a two-alternative forced-choice task selecting whether a car or face was present on each trial amidst visual noise pre-tested to approximate a 75% accuracy level. In an effort to disrupt processing, pairs of TMS pulses separated by 50 ms were presented at one of five stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs): -200, 200, 400, 450, or 500 ms. Behavioral performance differed systematically across SOAs for RT and accuracy measures. As predicted, TMS at 400 ms resulted in a significant slowing of RT. TMS delivered at -200 ms resulted in faster RT, indicating early stimulation may result in priming and performance enhancement.

Previous work has demonstrated that recovery in the presence of spared axons after an incomplete lesion increases behavioral output after a subsequent complete spinal cord transection (TX). This suggests that spared axons direct adaptive changes in below-level neuronal networks of the lumbar cord. In response to spared fibers, we postulate that lumbar neuron networks support behavioral gains by preventing aberrant plasticity. As such, the present study measured histological and functional changes in the isolated lumbar cord after complete TX or incomplete contusion (SCI). To measure functional plasticity in the lumbar cord, we used an established instrumental learning paradigm (ILP). In this paradigm, neural circuits within isolated lumbar segments demonstrate learning by an increase in flexion duration that reduces exposure to a noxious leg shock. We employed this model using a proof-of-principle design to evaluate the role of sparing on lumbar learning and plasticity early (7 days) or late (42 days) after midthoracic SCI in a rodent model. Early after SCI or TX at 7 days, spinal learning was unattainable regardless of whether the animal recovered with or without axonal substrate. Failed learning occurred alongside measures of cell soma atrophy and aberrant dendritic spine expression within interneuron populations responsible for sensorimotor integration and learning. Alternatively, exposure of the lumbar cord to a small amount of spared axons for 6 weeks produced near-normal learning late after SCI. This coincided with greater cell soma volume and fewer aberrant dendritic spines on interneurons. Thus, an opportunity to influence activity-based learning in locomotor networks depends on spared axons limiting maladaptive plasticity. Together, this work identifies a time dependent interaction between spared axonal systems and adaptive plasticity in locomotor networks and highlights a critical window for activity-based rehabilitation.", "publication_location": "Frontiers in Neural Circuits", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fncir.2016.00011", "citations": "15", "readership": "32", "tweets": "6", "news_mentions": " "},

Existing psychological evidence supports the hypothesis that episodes of mind-wandering reflect a failure to constrain thinking to task-relevant material, as well the apparently alternative view that control can facilitate the expression of self-generated mental content. We assessed whether this apparent contradiction arises because of a failure to consider differences in the types of thoughts that occur during mind-wandering, and in particular, the associated level of intentionality. Using multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis, we examined the cortical organisation that underlies inter-individual differences in descriptions of the spontaneous or deliberate nature of mind-wandering. Cortical thickness, as well as functional connectivity analyses, implicated regions relevant to cognitive control and regions of the default-mode network for individuals who reported high rates of deliberate mind-wandering. In contrast, higher reports of spontaneous mind-wandering were associated with cortical thinning in parietal and posterior temporal regions in the left hemisphere (which are important in the control of cognition and attention) as well as heightened connectivity between the intraparietal sulcus and a region that spanned limbic and default-mode regions in the ventral inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, we observed a dissociation in the thickness of the retrosplenial cortex/lingual gyrus, with higher reports of spontaneous mind-wandering being associated with thickening in the left hemisphere, and higher repots of deliberate mind-wandering with thinning in the right hemisphere. These results suggest that the intentionality of the mind-wandering state depends on integration between the control and default-mode networks, with more deliberation being associated with greater integration between these systems. We conclude that one reason why mind-wandering has a controversial relationship with control is because it depends on whether the thoughts emerge in a deliberate or spontaneous fashion.", "publication_location": "Neuroimage", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.11.025", "citations": "75", "readership": "169", "tweets": "30", "news_mentions": "9"},

Indeed, Huntington's disease (HD), which causes striatal atrophy in the BG, is characterized by hyperkinesia and chorea. How striatal cell loss alters activity in the BG and downstream motor cortical regions to cause these disorganized movements remains unknown. Here, we show that expressing the genetic mutation that causes HD in a song-related region of the songbird BG destabilizes syllable sequences and increases overall vocal activity, but leave the structure of individual syllables intact. These behavioral changes are paralleled by the selective loss of striatal neurons and reduction of inhibitory synapses on pallidal neurons that serve as the BG output. Chronic recordings in singing birds revealed disrupted temporal patterns of activity in pallidal neurons and downstream cortical neurons. Moreover, reversible inactivation of the cortical neurons rescued the disorganized vocal sequences in transfected birds.

METHOD: A monetary incentive delay task was used during fMRI scanning to assess neural responses in frontostriatal reward regions during reward anticipation and outcomes in 19 participants with remitted major depressive disorder (rMDD) and in 19 matched control participants. RESULTS: During the anticipation phase of the task, the rMDD group was characterized by relatively greater activation in bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus, in right midfrontal gyrus, and in the right cerebellum. During the outcome phase of the task, the rMDD group was characterized by relatively decreased activation in bilateral orbital frontal cortex, right frontal pole, left insular cortex, and left thalamus. Exploratory analyses indicated that activation within a right frontal pole cluster that differentiated groups during reward anticipation predicted the number of lifetime depressive episodes within the rMDD group. LIMITATIONS: Replication with larger samples is needed. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest a double dissociation between reward network reactivity and temporal phase of the reward response in rMDD, such that rMDD is generally characterized by reward network hyperactivation during reward anticipation and reward network hypoactivation during reward outcomes.

Yet, it remains unclear how these domain-general networks interact with focal brain regions to coordinate thought and action. Here, we investigated how the default-mode network (DMN) and executive control network (ECN), two networks associated with goal-directed behavior, shape task performance through their coupling with other cortical regions several seconds in advance of behavior. We measured these networks' connectivity during an adaptation of the monetary incentive delay (MID) response-time task in which human participants viewed social and nonsocial images (i.e., pictures of faces and landscapes, respectively) while brain activity was measured using fMRI. We found that participants displayed slower reaction times (RTs) subsequent to social trials relative to nonsocial trials. To examine the neural mechanisms driving this subsequent-RT effect, we integrated independent components analysis (ICA) and a network-based psychophysiological interaction (nPPI) analysis; this allowed us to investigate task-related changes in network coupling that preceded the observed trial-to-trial variation in RT. Strikingly, when subjects viewed social rewards, an area of the fusiform gyrus (FG) consistent with the functionally-defined fusiform face area (FFA) exhibited increased coupling with the ECN (relative to the DMN), and the relative magnitude of coupling tracked the slowing of RT on the following trial. These results demonstrate how large-scale, domain-general networks can interact with focal, domain-specific cortical regions to orchestrate subsequent behavior.", "publication_location": "Eneuro", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/eneuro.0084-17.2017", "citations": "6", "readership": "32", "tweets": "7", "news_mentions": " "},

Such a balance must be generated, at least partly, from local interconnected networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but the details of the local network structure are largely unknown. The dynamics of the neural activity depends on the local network structure; this in turn suggests the possibility of estimating network structure from the dynamics of the firing statistics. Here we report a new method to estimate properties of the local cortical network from the instantaneous firing rate and irregularity (CV(2)) under the assumption that recorded neurons are a part of a randomly connected sparse network. The firing irregularity, measured in monkey motor cortex, exhibits two features; many neurons show relatively stable firing irregularity in time and across different task conditions; the time-averaged CV(2) is widely distributed from quasi-regular to irregular (CV(2) = 0.3-1.0). For each recorded neuron, we estimate the three parameters of a local network [balance of local excitation-inhibition, number of recurrent connections per neuron, and excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) size] that best describe the dynamics of the measured firing rates and irregularities. Our analysis shows that optimal parameter sets form a two-dimensional manifold in the three-dimensional parameter space that is confined for most of the neurons to the inhibition-dominated region. High irregularity neurons tend to be more strongly connected to the local network, either in terms of larger EPSP and inhibitory PSP size or larger number of recurrent connections, compared with the low irregularity neurons, for a given excitatory/inhibitory balance. Incorporating either synaptic short-term depression or conductance-based synapses leads many low CV(2) neurons to move to the excitation-dominated region as well as to an increase of EPSP size.", "publication_location": "J Neurophysiol", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00858.2009", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

This paper considers a cortical network model in which this persistent activity appears due to recurrent synaptic interactions. The conditions under which the magnitude of spontaneous and persistent activity are close to one another (as is found empirically) are investigated using a simplified mean-field description in which firing rates in these states are given by the intersections of a straight line with the f-I curve of a single pyramidal cell. The present analysis relates a network phenomenon - persistent activity in a 'working memory' state - to single-cell data which are accessible to experiment. It predicts that, in networks of the cerebral cortex in which persistent activity phenomena are observed, average synaptic inputs in both spontaneous and persistent activity should bring the cells close to firing threshold. Cells should be slightly sub-threshold in spontaneous activity, and slightly supra-threshold in persistent activity.

Recently, we have demonstrated that our chemogenetic approach (eg, Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs)) provides a reliable and robust tool for controlling genetically defined neural populations. Here we show how short- and long-term activation of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonergic neurons induces robust behavioral responses.

Neuroimaging studies indicate a role for the insula in connecting the interoceptive awareness of tobacco craving with a larger brain network that motivates smoking. We investigated differences in insula-based functional connectivity between smokers who did not relapse during a quit attempt vs those who relapsed. Smokers (n=85) underwent a resting-state functional connectivity scan and were then randomized into two groups (either smoking usual brand cigarettes or smoking very low nicotine cigarettes plus nicotine replacement therapy) for 30 days before their target quit date. Following the quit date, all participants received nicotine replacement therapy and their smoking behavior was observed for 10 weeks. Participants were subsequently classified as nonrelapsed (n=44) or relapsed (i.e., seven consecutive days of smoking ⩾1 cigarette/day; n=41). The right and left insula, as well as insula subdivisions (posterior, ventroanterior, and dorsoanterior) were used as seed regions of interest in the connectivity analysis. Using the right and left whole-insula seed regions, the nonrelapsed group had greater functional connectivity than the relapsed group with the bilateral pre- and postcentral gyri. This effect was isolated to the right and left posterior insula seed regions. Our results suggest that relapse vulnerability is associated with weaker connectivity between the posterior insula and primary sensorimotor cortices. Perhaps greater connectivity in this network improves the ability to inhibit a motor response to cigarette cravings when those cravings conflict with a goal to remain abstinent. These results are consistent with recent studies demonstrating a positive relationship between insula-related functional connectivity and cessation likelihood among neurologically intact smokers.", "publication_location": "Neuropsychopharmacology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npp.2015.114", "citations": "44", "readership": "82", "tweets": "7", "news_mentions": "9"},

One hypothesis is that these opposing effects reflect a difference between attentional orienting towards internal events, such as retrieved memories, vs. external events, such as to-be-encoded stimuli. Another hypothesis is that hippocampal regions are coupled with the DMN during retrieval but decoupled from the DMN during encoding. The present fMRI study investigated these two hypotheses by combining a resting-state coherence analysis with a task that measured the encoding and retrieval of both internally-generated and externally-presented events. Results revealed that the main DMN regions were activated during retrieval but deactivated during encoding. Counter to the internal orienting hypothesis, this pattern was not modulated by whether memory events were internal or external.

First, the right hippocampus displayed greater communication efficiency with the network (shorter path length) and became a more convergent structure for information integration (higher centrality measures) for vivid than dim memories. Second, vivid minus dim differences in our graph theory measures of interest were greater in magnitude for the right hippocampus than for any other region in the 90-region network. Moreover, the right hippocampus significantly reorganized its set of direct connections from dim to vivid memory retrieval.

The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) during the resting state were compared among the three groups. Results: We observed ALFF differences between the three groups in the right inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula (IFG/AI), right middle temporal gyrus, left calcarine, and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Further region of interest (ROI) comparisons showed that the increases in the right IFG/AI reflected an abnormality specific to insomnia in MDD, while increases in the bilateral dlPFC reflected an abnormality specific to MDD generally. Increased ALFF in the right IFG/AI was also found to be correlated with sleep disturbance scores when regressing out the influence of the severity of anxiety and depression.

In the present fMRI study, we examined self-projection using a novel camera technology, which employs a sensor and timer to automatically take hundreds of photographs when worn, in order to create dynamic visuospatial cues taken from a first-person perspective. This allowed us to ask participants to self-project into the personal past or into the life of another person. We predicted that self-projection to the personal past would elicit greater activity in ventral mPFC, whereas self-projection of another perspective would rely on dorsal mPFC. There were three main findings supporting this prediction. First, we found that self-projection to the personal past recruited greater ventral mPFC, whereas observing another person's perspective recruited dorsal mPFC. Second, activity in ventral versus dorsal mPFC was sensitive to parametric modulation on each trial by the ability to relive the personal past or to understand another's perspective, respectively. Third, task-related functional connectivity analysis revealed that ventral mPFC contributed to the medial temporal lobe network linked to memory processes, whereas dorsal mPFC contributed to the fronto-parietal network linked to controlled processes.

However, before resting-state fMRI can be applied for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment for an individual patient with neurologic or psychiatric diseases, it is essential to assess its long-term reproducibility and between-subject variations among healthy individuals. The purpose of the study was to quantify the long-term test-retest reproducibility of ICN measures derived from resting-state fMRI and to assess the between-subject variation of ICN measures across the whole brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Longitudinal resting-state fMRI data of 6 healthy volunteers were acquired from 9 scan sessions during >1 year. The within-subject reproducibility and between-subject variation of ICN measures, across the whole brain and major nodes of the DMN, were quantified with the ICC and COV. RESULTS: Our data show that the long-term test-retest reproducibility of ICN measures is outstanding, with >70% of the connectivity networks showing an ICC > 0.60. The COV across 6 healthy volunteers in this sample was >0.2, suggesting significant between-subject variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that resting-state ICN measures (eg, the correlation coefficients between fMRI signal-intensity profiles from 2 different brain regions) are potentially suitable as biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and treatment effects in clinical trials and individual patients. Because between-subject variation is significant, it may be difficult to use quantitative ICN measures in their current state as a diagnostic tool.", "publication_location": "Ajnr Am J Neuroradiol", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3174/ajnr.A2894", "citations": "58", "readership": "124", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

In principal neurons, i.e., pyramidal and granule cells, this synchronized interneuron activity (SIA) generates large, multi-component synaptic potentials, which have been termed long-lasting depolarizations (LLDs). These LLDs are dependent on GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission but not on excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors. Intracellular recordings from hilar interneurons have shown that depolarizing GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic potentials are also largely responsible for the synchronization of interneurons. The spatiotemporal characteristics of this interneuron activity have not been investigated previously. Using a voltage-sensitive dye and optical techniques that are capable of recording spontaneous synchronized activity, we have characterized the spatiotemporal pattern of SIA (in the presence of 4-AP + EAA receptor antagonists) and compared it with interictal epileptiform activity (in 4-AP only). Like interictal activity, SIA could be observed throughout the hippocampal slice. Unlike interictal activity, which originated in area CA2/CA3 and spread from there, SIA was most prominent in area CA1 and originated either there or in the subiculum. In CA1, interictal activity was largest in and near stratum pyramidale, while SIA was mainly located in s. lacunosum moleculare. Furthermore SIA was equally likely to propagate in either direction, and multiple patterns of propagation could be observed within a single brain slice. These studies suggest that hippocampal area CA1 has the highest propensity for SIA, that multiple locations can serve as the site of origin, and that interneurons located in s. lacunosum moleculare or interneurons that specifically project to this region may be particularly important for synchronized interneuron activity.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neurophysiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.2001.86.1.381", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The network properties of the model were validated by comparing responses evoked in basal ganglia (BG) nuclei by cortical (CTX) stimulation to published experimental results. A key emergent property of the model was generation of low-frequency network oscillations. Consistent with their putative pathological role, low-frequency oscillations in model BG neurons were exaggerated in the parkinsonian state compared to the healthy condition. We used the model to quantify the effectiveness of STN DBS at different frequencies in suppressing low-frequency oscillatory activity in GPi. Frequencies less than 40 Hz were ineffective, low-frequency oscillatory power decreased gradually for frequencies between 50 Hz and 130 Hz, and saturated at frequencies higher than 150 Hz. HF STN DBS suppressed pathological oscillations in GPe/GPi both by exciting and inhibiting the firing in GPe/GPi neurons, and the number of GPe/GPi neurons influenced was greater for HF stimulation than low-frequency stimulation. Similar to the frequency dependent suppression of pathological oscillations, STN DBS also normalized the abnormal GPi spiking activity evoked by CTX stimulation in a frequency dependent fashion with HF being the most effective. Therefore, therapeutic HF STN DBS effectively suppresses pathological activity by influencing the activity of a greater proportion of neurons in the output nucleus of the BG.", "publication_location": "Journal of Computational Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10827-016-0593-9", "citations": "28", "readership": "83", "tweets": "1", "news_mentions": " "},

Using sex differences as a motivating example, we examined two separate resting-state datasets comprising a total of 188 human participants. Both datasets were decomposed into resting-state networks (RSNs) using a probabilistic spatial independent component analysis (ICA). We estimated voxel-wise functional connectivity with these networks using a dual-regression analysis, which characterizes the participant-level spatiotemporal dynamics of each network while controlling for (via multiple regression) the influence of other networks and sources of variability. We found that males and females exhibit distinct patterns of connectivity with multiple RSNs, including both visual and auditory networks and the right frontal-parietal network. These results replicated across both datasets and were not explained by differences in head motion, data quality, brain volume, cortisol levels, or testosterone levels. Importantly, we also demonstrate that dual-regression functional connectivity is better at detecting inter-individual variability than traditional seed-based functional connectivity approaches. Our findings characterize robust-yet frequently ignored-neural differences between males and females, pointing to the necessity of controlling for sex in neuroscience studies of individual differences.

Network controllability is a recent concept in network neuroscience that purports to predict the influence of individual cortical sites on global network states and state changes, thereby creating a unifying account of local influences on global brain dynamics. While this notion is accepted in engineering science, it is subject to ongoing debates in neuroscience as empirical evidence linking network controllability to brain activity and human behavior remains scarce. Here, we present an integrated set of multimodal brain-behavior relationships derived from fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied during an individually calibrated working memory task performed by individuals of both sexes. The modes describing the structural network system dynamics showed direct relationships to brain activity associated with task difficulty, with difficult-to-reach modes contributing to functional brain states in the hard task condition. Modal controllability (MC, a measure quantifying the contribution of difficult-to-reach modes) at the stimulated site predicted both fMRI activations associated with increasing task difficulty, and rTMS benefits on task performance. Furthermore, fMRI explained 64% of the variance between MC and the working memory benefit associated with 5Hz online rTMS. These results therefore provide evidence towards the functional validity of network control theory, and outline a clear technique for integrating structural network topology and functional activity to predict the influence of stimulation on subsequent behavior.Significance Statement:The network controllability concept proposes that specific cortical nodes are able to steer the brain into certain physiological states. By applying external perturbation to these control nodes, it is theorized that brain stimulation is able to selectively target difficult-to-reach states, potentially aiding processing and improving performance on cognitive tasks. The current study used rTMS and fMRI during a working memory task to test this hypothesis. We demonstrate that network controllability correlates with fMRI modulation due to working memory load and with the behavioral improvements that result from a multi-visit intervention using 5Hz rTMS.

To facilitate understanding of network-level synchronization between brain regions, we introduce a novel model of multisite low-frequency neural recordings, such as local field potentials (LFPs) and electroencephalograms (EEGs). The proposed model, named Cross-Spectral Factor Analysis (CSFA), breaks the observed signal into factors defined by unique spatio-spectral properties. These properties are granted to the factors via a Gaussian process formulation in a multiple kernel learning framework. In this way, the LFP signals can be mapped to a lower dimensional space in a way that retains information of relevance to neuroscientists. Critically, the factors are interpretable. The proposed approach empirically allows similar performance in classifying mouse genotype and behavioral context when compared to commonly used approaches that lack the interpretability of CSFA.

We recently documented the \"inhibition-induced forgetting effect\": no-go cues are remembered more poorly than go cues. We attributed this effect to central-resource competition, whereby response inhibition saps attention away from memory encoding. However, this proposal is difficult to test with behavioral means alone. We therefore used fMRI in humans to test two neural predictions of the \"common resource hypothesis\": (1) brain regions associated with response inhibition should exhibit greater resource demands during encoding of subsequently forgotten than remembered no-go cues; and (2) this higher inhibitory resource demand should lead to memory encoding regions having less resources available during encoding of subsequently forgotten no-go cues. Participants categorized face stimuli by gender in a go/no-go task and, following a delay, performed a surprise recognition memory test for those faces. Replicating previous findings, memory was worse for no-go than for go stimuli. Crucially, forgetting of no-go cues was predicted by high inhibitory resource demand, as quantified by the trial-by-trial ratio of activity in neural \"no-go\" versus \"go\" networks. Moreover, this index of inhibitory demand exhibited an inverse trial-by-trial relationship with activity in brain regions responsible for the encoding of no-go cues into memory, notably the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. This seesaw pattern between the neural resource demand of response inhibition and activity related to memory encoding directly supports the hypothesis that response inhibition temporarily saps attentional resources away from stimulus processing.Recent behavioral experiments showed that inhibiting a motor response to a stimulus (a \"no-go cue\") impairs subsequent memory for that cue. Here, we used fMRI to test whether this \"inhibition-induced forgetting effect\" is caused by competition for neural resources between the processes of response inhibition and memory encoding. We found that trial-by-trial variations in neural inhibitory resource demand predicted subsequent forgetting of no-go cues and that higher inhibitory demand was furthermore associated with lower concurrent activation in brain regions responsible for successful memory encoding of no-go cues. Thus, motor inhibition and stimulus encoding appear to compete with each other: when more resources have to be devoted to inhibiting action, less are available for encoding sensory stimuli.", "publication_location": "The Journal of Neuroscience : the Official Journal of the Society for Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.0519-15.2015", "citations": "15", "readership": "113", "tweets": "10", "news_mentions": "5"},

However, we lack a systematic understanding of how periodic stimulation interacts with endogenous neural activity as a function of the brain state and target. APPROACH:To address this critical issue, we applied periodic stimulation to a unified biophysical thalamic network model that generates multiple distinct oscillations, and examined thoroughly the impact of rhythmic stimulation on different oscillatory states. MAIN RESULTS:We found that rhythmic perturbation induces four basic response mechanisms: entrainment, acceleration, resonance and suppression. Importantly, the appearance and expression of these mechanisms depend highly on the intrinsic cellular dynamics in each state. Specifically, the low-threshold bursting of thalamocortical cells (TCs) in delta (δ) oscillation renders the network relatively insensitive to entrainment; the high-threshold bursting of TCs in alpha (α) oscillation leads to widespread oscillation suppression while the tonic spiking of TC cells in gamma (γ) oscillation results in prominent entrainment and resonance. In addition, we observed entrainment discontinuity during α oscillation that is mediated by firing pattern switching of high-threshold bursting TC cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that direct excitatory stimulation of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) entrains thalamic oscillations via an asymmetric Arnold tongue that favors higher frequency entrainment and resonance, while stimulation of the inhibitory circuit, the reticular nucleus, induces much weaker and more symmetric entrainment and resonance. These results support the notion that rhythmic stimulation engages brain oscillations in a state- and target-dependent manner. SIGNIFICANCE:Overall, our study provides, for the first time, insights into how the biophysics of thalamic oscillations guide the emergence of complex, state-dependent mechanisms of target engagement, which can be leveraged for the future rational design of novel therapeutic stimulation modalities.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neural Engineering", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/aaeb03", "citations": "1", "readership": "6", "tweets": "2", "news_mentions": " "},

Performance-based deficits are seen mainly in tests of working memory and executive function. Neural correlates of executive function were investigated in 18 FM patients and 14 age-matched healthy controls during a simple Go/No-Go task (response inhibition) while they underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Performance was not different between FM and healthy control, in either reaction time or accuracy. However, fMRI revealed that FM patients had lower activation in the right premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, midcingulate cortex, putamen and, after controlling for anxiety, in the right insular cortex and right inferior frontal gyrus. A hyperactivation in FM patients was seen in the right inferior temporal gyrus/fusiform gyrus. Despite the same reaction times and accuracy, FM patients show less brain activation in cortical structures in the inhibition network (specifically in areas involved in response selection/motor preparation) and the attention network along with increased activation in brain areas not normally part of the inhibition network. We hypothesize that response inhibition and pain perception may rely on partially overlapping networks, and that in chronic pain patients, resources taken up by pain processing may not be available for executive functioning tasks such as response inhibition. Compensatory cortical plasticity may be required to achieve performance on a par with control groups.Neural activation (fMRI) during response inhibition was measured in fibromyalgia patients and controls.

Here, we investigated how networks of excitatory and inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons responding to time-dependent inputs can be used to interpret sensory modulations of LFP spectra. We computed analytically from such models the LFP spectra and the information that they convey about input and used these analytical expressions to fit the model to LFPs recorded in V1 of anesthetized macaques (Macaca mulatta) during the presentation of color movies. Our expressions explain 60%-98% of the variance of the LFP spectrum shape and its dependency upon movie scenes and we achieved this with realistic values for the best-fit parameters.

We recorded Local Field Potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity from V1 of anaesthetized macaques during binocular presentation of Hollywood color movies. We analyzed these recordings with information theoretic methods, and found that visual information was encoded mainly by two bands of LFP responses: the network fluctuations measured by the phase and power of low-frequency (less than 12 Hz) LFPs; and fast gamma-range (50-100 Hz) oscillations. Both the power and phase of low frequency LFPs carried information largely complementary to that carried by spikes, whereas gamma range oscillations carried information largely redundant to that of spikes. To interpret these results within a quantitative theoretical framework, we then simulated a sparsely connected recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons receiving slowly varying naturalistic inputs, and we determined how the LFPs generated by the network encoded information about the inputs. We found that this simulated recurrent network reproduced well the experimentally observed dependency of LFP information upon frequency. This network encoded the overall strength of the input into the power of gamma-range oscillations generated by inhibitory-excitatory neural interactions, and encoded slow variations in the input by entraining the network LFP at the corresponding frequency. This dynamical behavior accounted quantitatively for the independent information carried by high and low frequency LFPs, and for the experimentally observed cross-frequency coupling between phase of slow LFPs and the power of gamma LFPs. We also present new results showing that the model's dynamics also accounted for the extra visual information that the low-frequency LFP phase of spike firing carries beyond that carried by spike rates.

Recently, it has been applied to help in better understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD). This review sought to synthesise existing literature on DTI studies in BD, summarise current findings and highlight brain regions that have consistently been implicated in BD, as well as posit possible future directions for DTI research in BD. The extant findings from this review suggest loss of white matter network connectivity as a possible phenomenon associated with bipolar disorder, involving prefrontal and frontal regions, projection, associative and commissural fibres, with sparse and less consistent evidence implicating the subcortical and non-frontal lobes of the brain. There are some differences in the direction of changes observed in white matter indices, and these may be attributed to factors including sample heterogeneity and limitations of DTI techniques. The possible roles of the parietal, temporal and occipital lobes and subcortical regions in BD await further investigation. Studies of bipolar disorder using DTI lag behind other neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, but DTI research in BD is fast gaining pace.

However, this view is largely based on findings of increased activation during tasks that fail to separate task-related processes (e.g., attention, decision making) from the cognitive process under examination. Here we take a systems-level approach to separate processes specific to language comprehension from those related to general task demands and to examine age differences in functional connectivity both within and between those systems. A large population-based sample (N = 111; 22-87 years) from the Cambridge Centre for Aging and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) was scanned using functional MRI during two versions of an experiment: a natural listening version in which participants simply listened to spoken sentences and an explicit task version in which they rated the acceptability of the same sentences. Independent components analysis across the combined data from both versions showed that although task-free language comprehension activates only the auditory and frontotemporal (FTN) syntax networks, performing a simple task with the same sentences recruits several additional networks. Remarkably, functionality of the critical FTN is maintained across age groups, showing no difference in within-network connectivity or responsivity to syntactic processing demands despite gray matter loss and reduced connectivity to task-related networks. We found no evidence for reduced specialization or compensation with age. Overt task performance was maintained across the lifespan and performance in older, but not younger, adults related to crystallized knowledge, suggesting that decreased between-network connectivity may be compensated for by older adults' richer knowledge base. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Understanding spoken language requires the rapid integration of information at many different levels of analysis. Given the complexity and speed of this process, it is remarkably well preserved with age. Although previous work claims that this preserved functionality is due to compensatory activation of regions outside the frontotemporal language network, we use a novel systems-level approach to show that these \"compensatory\" activations simply reflect age differences in response to experimental task demands. Natural, task-free language comprehension solely recruits auditory and frontotemporal networks, the latter of which is similarly responsive to language-processing demands across the lifespan. These findings challenge the conventional approach to neurocognitive aging by showing that the neural underpinnings of a given cognitive function depend on how you test it.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4561-15.2016", "citations": "20", "readership": "70", "tweets": "14", "news_mentions": "2"},

Active learning algorithms are able to make queries or select sample locations in an online fashion, depending on the results of the previous queries. In some regimes, this extra flexibility leads to significantly faster rates of error decay than those possible in classical passive learning settings. The nature of these regimes is explored by studying fundamental performance limits of active and passive learning in two illustrative nonparametric function classes. In addition to examining the theoretical potential of active learning, this paper describes a practical algorithm capable of exploiting the extra flexibility of the active setting and provably improving upon the classical passive techniques.

Population risk is always of primary interest in machine learning; however, learning algorithms only have access to the empirical risk. Even for applications with nonconvex nonsmooth losses (such as modern deep networks), the population risk is generally significantly more well-behaved from an optimization point of view than the empirical risk. In particular, sampling can create many spurious local minima. We consider a general framework which aims to optimize a smooth nonconvex function F (population risk) given only access to an approximation f (empirical risk) that is pointwise close to F (i.e., kF − fk∞ ≤ ν). Our objective is to find the -approximate local minima of the underlying function F while avoiding the shallow local minima-arising because of the tolerance ν-which exist only in f. We propose a simple algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a smoothed version of f that is guaranteed to achieve our goal as long as ν ≤ O(1.5/d). We also provide an almost matching lower bound showing that our algorithm achieves optimal error tolerance ν among all algorithms making a polynomial number of queries of f.

Navigating social hierarchy requires understanding one's own status relative to others and behaving accordingly, while achieving higher status may call upon cunning and strategic thinking. The neural mechanisms mediating social status have become increasingly well understood in invertebrates and model organisms like fish and mice but until recently have remained more opaque in humans and other primates. In a new study in this issue, Noonan and colleagues explore the neural correlates of social rank in macaques. Using both structural and functional brain imaging, they found neural changes associated with individual monkeys' social status, including alterations in the amygdala, hypothalamus, and brainstem--areas previously implicated in dominance-related behavior in other vertebrates. A separate but related network in the temporal and prefrontal cortex appears to mediate more cognitive aspects of strategic social behavior. These findings begin to delineate the neural circuits that enable us to navigate our own social worlds.

Response timing characteristics were also examined for any association with observed between-condition activity differences. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Malingered recognition memory errors, regardless of type, were associated with inferior parietal and superior temporal activity relative to normal performance, while feigned recognition target misses produced additional dorsomedial frontal activation and feigned foil false alarms activated bilateral ventrolateral frontal regions. Malingered response times were associated with activity in the dorsomedial frontal, temporal and inferior parietal regions. Normal memory responses were associated with greater inferior occipitotemporal and dorsomedial parietal activity, suggesting greater reliance upon visual/attentional networks for proper task performance.

The majority of the BOLD signals are believed to arise from the venous and capillary networks. However, only those from the capillaries are spatially close to the neuronal activities, while the signals from large veins could be distant, rendering the overall localization inaccurate. In recent years, an alternative contrast using arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion imaging techniques has been proposed for predominant capillary sensitivity. Such acquisition methods, however, are intrinsically limited in temporal resolution and spatial coverage. Another contrast mechanism, free of such constraints, is based on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) changes during brain activation using isotropic diffusion weighting. It has been shown that these changes are synchronized with brain activation and that they, as a whole, temporally precede BOLD activation, suggesting significant upstream arterial contribution. Moreover, the spatial overlaps between the upstream ADC and downstream BOLD activations are shown to be more localized in the capillaries, which are the temporal and spatial middle ground. In this paper, we sought to further investigate the temporal and spatial characteristics of ADC contrast with additional arterial signal suppression. Also, a pixel-based evaluation was performed in conjunction with the averaged global assessment. It was found that in addition to the known spatial discrepancy and global timing advance compared to the BOLD signal, the ADC activation endured significant temporal heterogeneities. Such fine spatial and temporal assessment could help characterize the exact signal sources of ADC contrast, and ultimately achieve exclusive capillary sensitivity.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neural Engineering", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1741-2560/1/1/005", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

We measured the impedance of DBS electrodes using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in vitro in a carbonate- and phosphate-buffered saline solution and in vivo following acute implantation in the brain. The components of the impedance, including the series resistance (R(s)), the Faradaic resistance (R(f)) and the double layer capacitance (C(dl)), were estimated using an equivalent electrical circuit. Both R(f) and C(dl) decreased as the sinusoidal frequency was increased, but the ratio of the capacitive charge transfer to the Faradaic charge transfer was relatively insensitive to the change of frequency. R(f) decreased and C(dl) increased as the current density was increased, and above a critical current density the interface impedance became nonlinear. Thus, the magnitude of the interface impedance was strongly dependent on the intensity (pulse amplitude and duration) of stimulation. The temporal dependence and spatial non-uniformity of R(f) and C(dl) suggested that a distributed network, with each element of the network having dynamics tailored to a specific stimulus waveform, is required to describe adequately the impedance of the DBS electrode-tissue interface.

However, inferring brain connectivity from R-fMRI is a challenging task, particularly when the ultimate goal is to achieve good control-patient classification performance, owing to perplexing noise effects, curse of dimensionality, and inter-subject variability. Incorporating sparsity into connectivity modeling may be a possible solution to partially remedy this problem since most biological networks are intrinsically sparse. Nevertheless, sparsity constraint, when applied at an individual level, will inevitably cause inter-subject variability and hence degrade classification performance. To this end, we formulate the R-fMRI time series of each region of interest (ROI) as a linear representation of time series of other ROIs to infer sparse connectivity networks that are topologically identical across individuals. This formulation allows simultaneous selection of a common set of ROIs across subjects so that their linear combination is best in estimating the time series of the considered ROI. Specifically, l 1-norm is imposed on each subject to filter out spurious or insignificant connections to produce sparse networks. A group-constraint is hence imposed via multi-task learning using a l 2-norm to encourage consistent non-zero connections across subjects. This group-constraint is crucial since the network topology is identical for all subjects while still preserving individual information via different connectivity values. We validated the proposed modeling in mild cognitive impairment identification and promising results achieved demonstrate its superiority in disease characterization, particularly greater sensitivity to early stage brain pathologies. The inferred group-constrained sparse network is found to be biologically plausible and is highly associated with the disease-associated anatomical anomalies. Furthermore, our proposed approach achieved similar classification performance when finer atlas was used to parcellate the brain space.", "publication_location": "Brain Struct Funct", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00429-013-0524-8", "citations": "85", "readership": "77", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Performance-based deficits are seen mainly in tests of working memory and executive functioning. It has been hypothesized that pain interferes with cognitive performance; however, the neural correlates of this interference are still a matter of debate. In a previous, cross-sectional study, we reported that fibromyalgia patients (as compared with healthy controls) showed a decreased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response related to response inhibition (in a simple Go/No-Go task) in the anterior/mid cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, and right premotor cortex. METHODS: Here in this longitudinal study, neural activation elicited by response inhibition was assessed again in the same cohort of fibromyalgia patients and healthy controls using the same Go/No-Go paradigm. RESULTS: A decrease in percentage of body pain distribution was associated with an increase in BOLD signal in the anterior/mid cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area, regions that have previously been shown to be \"hyporeactive\" in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the clinical distribution of pain is associated with the BOLD response elicited by a cognitive task. The cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area are critically involved in both the pain system as well as the response inhibition network. We hypothesize that increases in the spatial distribution of pain might engage greater neural resources, thereby reducing their availability for other networks.

Comparative analyses can contribute to this effort by leading to the discovery of general principles of neural circuit design, information processing, and gene-structure-function relationships that are not apparent from studies on single species. We here propose to extend the comparative approach to nervous system 'maps' comprising molecular, anatomical, and physiological data. This research will identify which neural features are likely to generalize across species, and which are unlikely to be broadly conserved. It will also suggest causal relationships between genes, development, adult anatomy, physiology, and, ultimately, behavior. These causal hypotheses can then be tested experimentally. Finally, insights from comparative research can inspire and guide technological development. To promote this research agenda, we recommend that teams of investigators coalesce around specific research questions and select a set of 'reference species' to anchor their comparative analyses. These reference species should be chosen not just for practical advantages, but also with regard for their phylogenetic position, behavioral repertoire, well-annotated genome, or other strategic reasons. We envision that the nervous systems of these reference species will be mapped in more detail than those of other species. The collected data may range from the molecular to the behavioral, depending on the research question. To integrate across levels of analysis and across species, standards for data collection, annotation, archiving, and distribution must be developed and respected. To that end, it will help to form networks or consortia of researchers and centers for science, technology, and education that focus on organized data collection, distribution, and training.

This change may help counteract age-related neurocognitive decline (compensation hypothesis) or it may reflect an age-related difficulty in recruiting specialized neural mechanisms (dedifferentiation hypothesis). To compare these two hypotheses, we measured PFC activity in younger adults, low-performing older adults, and high-performing older adults during recall and source memory of recently studied words. Compared to recall, source memory was associated with right PFC activations in younger adults. Low-performing older adults recruited similar right PFC regions as young adults, but high-performing older adults engaged PFC regions bilaterally. Thus, consistent with the compensation hypothesis and inconsistent with the dedifferentiation hypothesis, a hemispheric asymmetry reduction was found in high-performing but not in low-performing older adults.

In experiment I, we identified four DDT-related brain networks. The money network (the striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, etc.) and the time network (the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, etc.) were associated with the valuation process; the frontoparietal network and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex-anterior insular cortex network were related to the choice process.

The action space of the resulting MDP is the joint action space of the entire set of agents. Our approach is based on the use of factored linear value functions as an approximation to the joint value function. This factorization of the value function allows the agents to coordinate their actions at runtime using a natural message passing scheme. We provide a simple and efficient method for computing such an approximate value function by solving a single linear program, whose size is determined by the interaction between the value function structure and the DBN.We thereby avoid the exponential blowup in the state and action space.

This work proposes a novel approach, the Multiple Domain Matching Network (MDMN), to exploit this structure. MDMN embeds all data into a shared feature space while learning which domains share strong statistical relationships. These relationships are often insightful in their own right, and they allow domains to share strength without interference from irrelevant data. This methodology builds on existing distribution-matching approaches by assuming that source domains are varied and outcomes multi-factorial. Therefore, each domain should only match a relevant subset. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed approach can have a tighter generalization bound than existing multiple-domain adaptation approaches.

In particular, both younger and older adult populations recruit bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) as a means of compensating for increasing neural effort to maintain successful cognitive function. However, it remains unclear how local changes in neural activity affect the recruitment of this adaptive mechanism. To address this problem, we combined graph theoretical measures from functional MRI with diffusion weighted imaging and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to resolve a central hypothesis: how do aged brains flexibly adapt to local changes in cortical activity? Specifically, we applied neuromodulation to increase or decrease local activity in a cortical region supporting successful memory encoding (left dorsolateral PFC or DLPFC) using 5 or 1 Hz rTMS, respectively. We then assessed a region's local within-module degree, or the distributed between-module degree (BMD) between distant cortical communities. We predicted that (1) local stimulation-related deficits may be counteracted by boosting BMD between bilateral PFC, and that this effect should be (2) positively correlated with structural connectivity. Both predictions were confirmed; 5 Hz rTMS increased local success-related activity and local increases in PFC connectivity, while 1 Hz rTMS decreases local activity and triggered a more distributed pattern of bilateral PFC connectivity to compensate for this local inhibitory effect. These results provide an integrated, causal explanation for the network interactions associated with successful memory encoding in older adults.

Current studies on functional brain networks and their alterations in brain diseases via resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are generally either at local scale (regionally confined analysis and inter-regional functional connectivity analysis) or at global scale (graph theoretic analysis). In contrast, inferring functional interaction at fine-granularity sub-network scale has not been adequately explored yet. Here our hypothesis is that functional interaction measured at fine-granularity sub-network scale can provide new insight into the neural mechanisms of neurological and psychological conditions, thus offering complementary information for healthy and diseased population classification. In this paper, we derived fine-granularity functional interaction (FGFI) signatures in subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Schizophrenia by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and rs-fMRI, and used patient-control classification experiments to evaluate the distinctiveness of the derived FGFI features. Our experimental results have shown that the FGFI features alone can achieve comparable classification performance compared with the commonly used inter-regional connectivity features. However, the classification performance can be substantially improved when FGFI features and inter-regional connectivity features are integrated, suggesting the complementary information achieved from the FGFI signatures.", "publication_location": "Neuroinformatics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12021-013-9177-2", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Prior research has shown, among cigarette smokers, that nicotine administration alters rsFC within frontal and parietal cortices involved in executive control, as well as striatal regions that drive reward processing. These changes in rsFC have been associated with reductions in withdrawal symptom severity. We currently have a limited understanding of how rsFC is affected by the use of electronic cigarettes (ecigs), an increasingly popular class of products, the members of which deliver nicotine with varying effectiveness. The current study used fMRI to determine the effects of ecig use on rsFC and withdrawal symptoms. Independent component, dual regression, and permutation analyses were conducted on rsFC collected from ecig users before and after an ecig use episode (n=9) that occurred after 14h of nicotine abstinence. Similar to the known effects of nicotine administration, ecig use decreased rsFC of two clusters in the right frontal pole and frontal medial cortex with an attentional control salience network, and decreased rsFC of five clusters in the left thalamus, insula, and brain stem with a reward network encompassing the striatum. Ecig use increased inverse coupling between the prefrontal reward network and the right frontoparietal executive control network. Reductions in craving and difficulty with concentration were correlated with decreases in coupling strength between reward and executive control networks. These preliminary results suggest that the effects of ecig use on rsFC are similar to those seen with nicotine administration in other forms. In order to gain insight into the addictive potential of ecigs, further research is needed to understand the neural influence of ecigs across the range of nicotine delivery within this class of products.", "publication_location": "Brain Research Bulletin", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2017.05.010", "citations": "8", "readership": "55", "tweets": "11", "news_mentions": " "},

The results from two experiments revealed between-systems differences, but also between-systems similarities and within-system differences.

During functional MRI scanning, participants completed a conjunction visual search task in which each display contained one item that was larger than the other items (i.e., a size singleton) but was not informative regarding target identity. This design allowed us to examine in the RT components and functional network measures the influence of (a) additional bottom-up guidance when the target served as the size singleton, relative to when the distractor served as the size singleton (i.e., size singleton effect) and (b) top-down processes during target detection (i.e., target detection effect; target present vs. absent trials). We found that the size singleton effect (i.e., increased bottom-up guidance) was associated with RT components related to decision and nondecision processes, but these effects did not vary with age. Also, a modularity analysis revealed that frontoparietal module connectivity was important for both the size singleton and target detection effects, but this module became central to the networks through different mechanisms for each effect. Lastly, participants 42 years of age and older, in service of the target detection effect, relied more on between-frontoparietal module connections.

Apical force-producing actomyosin networks drive apical constriction by contracting while connected to cell-cell junctions. The mechanisms by which developmental patterning regulates these actomyosin networks and associated junctions with spatial precision are not fully understood. Here we identify a myosin light-chain kinase MRCK-1 as a key regulator of C. elegans gastrulation that integrates spatial and developmental patterning information. We show that MRCK-1 is required for activation of contractile actomyosin dynamics and elevated cortical tension in the apical cell cortex of endoderm precursor cells. MRCK-1 is apically localized by active Cdc42 at the external, cell-cell contact-free surfaces of apically constricting cells, downstream of cell fate determination mechanisms. We establish that the junctional components α-catenin, β-catenin, and cadherin become highly enriched at the apical junctions of apically constricting cells and that MRCK-1 and myosin activity are required in vivo for this enrichment. Taken together, our results define mechanisms that position a myosin activator to a specific cell surface where it both locally increases cortical tension and locally enriches junctional components to facilitate apical constriction.

Recent work has shown that topological properties of functional brain networks are associated with individual and group differences in cognitive performance, including in episodic memory. After constructing functional whole-brain networks derived from an event-related fMRI study of memory retrieval, we examined differences in functional brain network architecture between forgotten and remembered words. This study yielded three main findings. First, graph theory analyses showed that successfully remembering compared to forgetting was associated with significant changes in the connectivity profile of the left hippocampus and a corresponding increase in efficient communication with the rest of the brain. Second, bivariate functional connectivity analyses indicated stronger interactions between the left hippocampus and a retrieval assembly for remembered versus forgotten items. This assembly included the left precuneus, left caudate, bilateral supramarginal gyrus, and the bilateral dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus. Integrative properties of the retrieval assembly were greater for remembered than forgotten items. Third, whole-brain modularity analyses revealed that successful memory retrieval was marginally significantly associated with a less segregated modular architecture in the network. The magnitude of the decreases in modularity between remembered and forgotten conditions was related to memory performance. These findings indicate that increases in integrative properties at the nodal, retrieval assembly, and whole-brain topological levels facilitate memory retrieval, while also underscoring the potential of multivariate brain connectivity approaches for providing valuable new insights into the neural bases of memory processes.

When compared with placebo, pregnenolone administration reduced connectivity between amygdala and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, between amygdala and precuneus, and between amygdala and hippocampus. DHEA reduced connectivity between amygdala and periamygdala and between amygdala and insula. Reductions in amygdala to precuneus connectivity were associated with less self-reported negative affect.

Seed-based connectivity analyses were conducted using seeds from cerebellum regions previously identified as being involved in the executive, default-mode, affective-limbic, and motor networks. The results revealed that, compared with controls, individuals with depression show reduced functional connectivity between several cerebellum seed regions, specifically those in the executive and affective-limbic networks with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and increased functional connectivity between the motor-related cerebellum seed regions with the putamen and motor cortex.

This study evaluated the effect of symptoms of depression and/or clinically diagnosed major depressive disorder (MDD) on pain processing in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). METHODS: Results of quantitative sensory testing and neural responses to equally painful pressure stimuli (measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) were compared with the levels of symptoms of depression and comorbid MDD among patients with FM. RESULTS: Neither the level of symptoms of depression nor the presence of comorbid MDD was associated with the results of sensory testing or the magnitude of neuronal activation in brain areas associated with the sensory dimension of pain (primary and secondary somatosensory cortices). However, symptoms of depression and the presence of MDD were associated with the magnitude of pain-evoked neuronal activations in brain regions associated with affective pain processing (the amygdalae and contralateral anterior insula). Clinical pain intensity was associated with measures of both the sensory dimension of pain (results of sensory testing) and the affective dimension of pain (activations in the insula bilaterally, contralateral anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex). CONCLUSION: In patients with FM, neither the extent of depression nor the presence of comorbid major depression modulates the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain processing (i.e., localizing pain and reporting its level of intensity), as measured by sensory testing or fMRI. However, depression is associated with the magnitude of neuronal activation in brain regions that process the affective-motivational dimension of pain. These data suggest that there are parallel, somewhat independent neural pain-processing networks for sensory and affective pain elements.

We predicted temporal intervals from the activity of hundreds of neurons recorded in motor and premotor cortex as rhesus monkeys performed self-timed hand movements. During the delay periods, when animals had to estimate temporal intervals and prepare hand movements, neuronal ensemble activity encoded both the time that elapsed from the previous hand movement and the time until the onset of the next. The neurons that were most informative of these temporal intervals increased or decreased their rates throughout the delay until reaching a threshold value, at which point a movement was initiated. Variability in the self-timed delays was explainable by the variability of neuronal rates, but not of the threshold. In addition to predicting temporal intervals, the same neuronal ensemble activity was informative for generating predictions that dissociated the delay periods of the task from the movement periods. Left hemispheric areas were the best source of predictions in one bilaterally implanted monkey overtrained to perform the task with the right hand. However, after that monkey learned to perform the task with the left hand, its left hemisphere continued and the right hemisphere started contributing to the prediction.

Within this whole-brain signature, the intrinsic connectivity of the default mode network was most informative of suppression tendency.

These differing demands should be expected to produce variation in the relative sizes of various brain structures. Sexual selection on males can be predicted to influence brain components handling sensory-motor skills that are important for physical competition or neural pathways involving aggression. Conversely, because female fitness is more closely linked to ecological factors and social interactions that enable better acquisition of resources, social selection on females should select for brain components important for navigating social networks. Sexual and social selection acting on one sex could produce sexual dimorphism in brain structures, which would result in larger species averages for those same brain structures. Alternatively, sex-specific selection pressures could produce correlated effects in the other sex, resulting in larger brain structures for both males and females of a species. Data are presently unavailable for the sex-specific sizes of brain structures for anthropoid primates, but under either scenario, the effects of sexual and social selection should leave a detectable signal in average sizes of brain structures for different species. RESULTS:The degree of male intra-sexual selection was positively correlated with several structures involved in autonomic functions and sensory-motor skills, and in pathways relating to aggression and aggression control. The degree of male intra-sexual selection was not correlated with relative neocortex size, which instead was significantly positively correlated with female social group size, but negatively correlated with male group size. CONCLUSION:Sexual selection on males and social selection on females have exerted different effects on primate brain architecture. Species with a higher degree of male intra-sexual selection carry a neural signature of an evolutionary history centered on physical conflicts, but no traces of increased demands on sociocognitive tasks. Conversely, female sociality is indicated to have driven the evolution of socio-cognitive skills. Primate brain architecture is therefore likely to be a product of ecological and species-specific social factors as well as different sex-specific selection pressures. Our results also highlight the need for acquisition and analysis of sex-specific brain components in mammals.", "publication_location": "Bmc Biology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-5-20", "citations": "50", "readership": "138", "tweets": "1", "news_mentions": " "},

Intracranial EEG (iEEG) captured during extended inpatient monitoring of patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy offers a particularly promising method to study MDD networks in epilepsy. METHODS: The authors used 24 hours of resting-state iEEG to examine the neural activity patterns within corticolimbic structures that reflected the presence of depressive symptoms in 13 adults with medication-refractory epilepsy. Principal component analysis was performed on the z-scored mean relative power in five standard frequency bands averaged across electrodes within a region. RESULTS: Principal component 3 was a statistically significant predictor of the presence of depressive symptoms (R2=0.35, p=0.014). A balanced logistic classifier model using principal component 3 alone correctly classified 78% of patients as belonging to the group with a high burden of depressive symptoms or a control group with minimal depressive symptoms (sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 80%; area under the curve=0.8, leave-one-out cross validation). Classification was dependent on beta power throughout the corticolimbic network and low-frequency cingulate power.

Comparative analyses can contribute to this effort by leading to the discovery of general principles of neural circuit design, information processing, and gene-structure-function relationships that are not apparent from studies on single species. We here propose to extend the comparative approach to nervous system 'maps' comprising molecular, anatomical, and physiological data. This research will identify which neural features are likely to generalize across species, and which are unlikely to be broadly conserved. It will also suggest causal relationships between genes, development, adult anatomy, physiology, and, ultimately, behavior. These causal hypotheses can then be tested experimentally. Finally, insights from comparative research can inspire and guide technological development. To promote this research agenda, we recommend that teams of investigators coalesce around specific research questions and select a set of 'reference species' to anchor their comparative analyses. These reference species should be chosen not just for practical advantages, but also with regard for their phylogenetic position, behavioral repertoire, well-annotated genome, or other strategic reasons. We envision that the nervous systems of these reference species will be mapped in more detail than those of other species. The collected data may range from the molecular to the behavioral, depending on the research question. To integrate across levels of analysis and across species, standards for data collection, annotation, archiving, and distribution must be developed and respected. To that end, it will help to form networks or consortia of researchers and centers for science, technology, and education that focus on organized data collection, distribution, and training. These activities could be supported, at least in part, through existing mechanisms at NSF, NIH, and other agencies.

However, the contribution from veins can be relatively far downstream from active neurons, thereby limiting the ability of BOLD imaging methods to precisely pinpoint neural generators. Hemodynamic measures based on apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) have recently been used to identify more upstream functional blood flow changes in the capillaries, arterioles and arteries. In particular, we recently showed that, due to the complementary vascular sensitivities of ADC and BOLD signals, the voxels conjointly activated by both measures may identify the capillary networks of the active neuronal areas. In this study, we first used simultaneously acquired ADC and BOLD functional imaging signals to identify brain voxels activated by ADC only, by both ADC and BOLD and by BOLD only, thereby delineating voxels relatively dominated by the arterial, capillary, and draining venous neurovascular compartments, respectively. We then examined the event-related fMRI BOLD responses in each of these delineated neurovascular compartments, hypothesizing that their event-related responses would show different temporal componentries. In the regions activated by both the BOLD and ADC contrasts, but not in the BOLD-only areas, we observed an initial transient signal reduction (an initial dip), consistent with the local production of deoxyhemoglobin by the active neuronal population. In addition, the BOLD-ADC overlap areas and the BOLD-only areas showed a clear poststimulus undershoot, whereas the compartment activated by only ADC did not show this component. These results indicate that using ADC contrast in conjunction with BOLD imaging can help delineate the various neurovascular compartments, improve the localization of active neural populations, and provide insight into the physiological mechanisms underlying the hemodynamic signals.", "publication_location": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mri.2006.08.010", "citations": "9", "readership": "34", "tweets": "2", "news_mentions": " "},

Previous large-scale behavioral studies indicate that people with AMD are at increased risk of cognitive deficits in language processing, particularly in verbal fluency tasks. The neural underpinnings of any relationship between AMD and higher cognitive functions, such as language processing, remain unclear. This study aims to address this issue using independent component analysis of spontaneous brain activity at rest. In 2 components associated with visual processing, we observed weaker functional connectivity in the primary visual cortex and lateral occipital cortex in AMD patients compared with healthy controls, indicating that AMD might lead to differences in the neural representation of vision. In a component related to language processing, we found that increasing connectivity within the right inferior frontal gyrus was associated with better verbal fluency performance across all older adults, and the verbal fluency effect was greater in AMD patients than controls in both right inferior frontal gyrus and right posterior temporal regions. As the behavioral performance of our patients is as good as that of controls, these findings suggest that preservation of verbal fluency performance in AMD patients might be achieved through higher contribution from right hemisphere regions in bilateral language networks.

METHODS: Here we acquired multicircuit in vivo activity from eight cortical and limbic brain regions as mice were subjected to the tail suspension test (TST) and an open field test. We used a linear decoder to determine whether cellular responses across each of the cortical and limbic areas signal movement during the TST and open field test. We then performed repeat behavioral testing to identify which brain areas show cellular adaptations that signal the increase in immobility induced by repeat TST exposure. RESULTS: The increase in immobility observed during repeat TST exposure is linked to a selective functional upregulation of cellular activity in infralimbic cortex and medial dorsal thalamus, and to an increase in the spatiotemporal dynamic interaction between these structures. Inducing this spatiotemporal dynamic using closed-loop optogenetic stimulation is sufficient to increase movement in the TST in stress-naive mice, while stimulating above the carrier frequency of this circuit suppressed movement. This demonstrates that the adaptations in infralimbic cortex-medial dorsal thalamus circuitry observed after stress reflect a compensatory mechanism whereby the brain drives neural systems to counterbalance stress effects.

Animal models show profound glycogen accumulation in spinal and medullary respiratory neurons and altered neural activity. Tissues from Pompe patients show central nervous system glycogen accumulation and motoneuron pathology. A neural mechanism raises considerations about the current clinical approach of enzyme replacement since the recombinant protein does not cross the blood-brain-barrier.

However, fundamental questions remain about the effects of DBS on neurons surrounding the electrode. Experimental studies have produced apparently contradictory results showing suppression of activity in the stimulated nucleus, but increased inputs to projection nuclei. We hypothesized that cell body firing does not accurately reflect the efferent output of neurons stimulated with high-frequency extracellular pulses, and that this decoupling of somatic and axonal activity explains the paradoxical experimental results. We studied stimulation using the combination of a finite-element model of the clinical DBS electrode and a multicompartment cable model of a thalamocortical (TC) relay neuron. Both the electric potentials generated by the electrode and a distribution of excitatory and inhibitory trans-synaptic inputs induced by stimulation of presynaptic terminals were applied to the TC relay neuron. The response of the neuron to DBS was primarily dependent on the position and orientation of the axon with respect to the electrode and the stimulation parameters. Stimulation subthreshold for direct activation of TC relay neurons caused suppression of intrinsic firing (tonic or burst) activity during the stimulus train mediated by activation of presynaptic terminals. Suprathreshold stimulation caused suppression of intrinsic firing in the soma, but generated efferent output at the stimulus frequency in the axon. This independence of firing in the cell body and axon resolves the apparently contradictory experimental results on the effects of DBS.

Twenty-five healthy young adults (n = 21 female, mean age = 20.6 ± 1.1 years, mean BMI = 22.1 ± 1.9 kg/m2) rated the MaPS images in terms of visual interest, appetitive quality, nutrition, emotional valence, liking, and frequency of consumption, and completed the FPQ.

In particular, both younger and older adult populations recruit bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) as a means of compensating for increasing neural effort to maintain successful cognitive function. However, it remains unclear how local changes in neural activity affect the recruitment of this adaptive mechanism. To address this problem, we combined graph theoretical measures from functional MRI (fMRI) with diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in order to resolve a central hypothesis: how do aged brains flexibly adapt to local changes in cortical activity? Specifically, we applied neuromodulation to increase or decrease local activity in a cortical region supporting successful memory encoding (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or DLPFC) using 5Hz or 1Hz rTMS, respectively. We then assessed a region’s local within-module degree (WMD), or the distributed between-module degree (BMD) between distant cortical communities. We predicted that (1) local stimulation-related deficits may be counteracted by boosting BMD between bilateral PFC, and that this effect should be (2) positively correlated with structural connectivity. Both predictions were confirmed; 5Hz rTMS increased local success-related activity and local increases in PFC connectivity, while 1Hz rTMS decreases local activity and triggered a more distributed pattern of bilateral PFC connectivity to compensate for this local inhibitory effect. These results provide an integrated, causal explanation for the network interactions associated with successful memory encoding in older adults.", "publication_location": " ", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/061267", "citations": "3", "readership": "8", "tweets": "15", "news_mentions": " "},

OBJECTIVE: To develop a multi-scale computational model to quantify the effect of TMS parameters on the direct response of individual neurons. METHODS: We integrated morphologically-realistic neuronal models with TMS-induced electric fields computed in a finite element model of a human head to quantify the cortical response to TMS with several combinations of pulse waveforms and current directions. RESULTS: TMS activated with lowest intensity intracortical axonal terminations in the superficial gyral crown and lip regions. Layer 5 pyramidal cells had the lowest thresholds, but layer 2/3 pyramidal cells and inhibitory basket cells were also activated at most intensities. Direct activation of layers 1 and 6 was unlikely. Neural activation was largely driven by the field magnitude, rather than the field component normal to the cortical surface. Varying the induced current direction caused a waveform-dependent shift in the activation site and provided a potential mechanism for experimentally observed differences in thresholds and latencies of muscle responses. CONCLUSIONS: This biophysically-based simulation provides a novel method to elucidate mechanisms and inform parameter selection of TMS and other cortical stimulation modalities.

Recently, increased sensory hypersensitivity has been linked to greater activity of the neural salience network (Green et al., 2016). Increased neural sensitivity to stimuli, especially social stimuli, could provide greater opportunity for social learning and improved outcomes. Consistent with this framework, in Experiment 1 we found that parent report of greater sensory hypersensitivity at 2 years in toddlers with ASD (N=27) was predictive of increased neural responsiveness to social stimuli (larger amplitude event-related potential/ERP responses to faces at P1, P400 and Nc) at 4 years, and this in turn was related to parent report of increased social approach at 4 years. In Experiment 2, parent report of increased perceptual sensitivity at 6 months in infants at low and high familial risk for ASD (N=35) predicted larger ERP P1 amplitude to faces at 18 months. Increased sensory hypersensitivity in early development thus predicted greater attention capture by faces in later development, and this related to more optimal social behavioral development.

The multi-unit Shannon information rates were compared with those of the constituent single-unit spike trains and also with those of corresponding labelled line signals. The mutual information in the multi-unit response was found to depend on the degree of similarity in the attribute-specific information of the single-unit spike trains. As long as the units were encoding similar attribute-specific information, the multi-unit signal had greater information than any of the individual units. If the units' responses were confounded by different amounts, the multi-unit response could not recover the maximal single-unit information. Labelled line and pooled responses had similar mutual information when the information in the constituent units was similar. However, the normalized gain in information of a labelled line response over a pooled response increased from 27% to 84%, relative to the maximum single-unit information rate, as the difference in constituent single-unit information increased to 100%.

To investigate mediating neural mechanisms, we designed a visual search task in which central cues signaled future location and emotional expression (angry or neutral) of a target face. Cues predicting angry targets accelerated subsequent attention shifts, indicating that endogenous signals predicting threatening events can prime the spatial attention network. Functional imaging showed that spatially informative cues activated the fusiform gyrus (FG) as well as frontoparietal components of the spatial attention network, including intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and frontal eye field (FEF), whereas cues predicting angry faces also activated limbic areas, including the amygdala. Anatomically overlapping, additive effects of spatial and emotional cuing were identified in the IPS, FEFs, and FG, regions that also displayed augmented connectivity with the amygdala after cues predicting angry faces. These data highlight a key role for the frontoparietal spatial attention network in the compilation of a salience map that combines the spatial coordinates of an event with its motivational relevance.

To address this question, we developed a novel analysis of human functional magnetic resonance imaging data that fits models of network excitation and inhibition on ventral tegmental area (VTA) activation. We show that specific afferent systems predict distinct temporal components of midbrain VTA signal. We found that PFC, but not HPC, positively predicted transient, event-evoked VTA activation. In contrast, HPC, but not PFC, positively predicted slow shifts in VTA baseline variability. Thus, unique functional contributions of afferent systems to VTA physiology are detectable at the network level in behaving humans.

This phylogenetic position means that the sea urchin can provide insights into the evolution of the nervous system by helping resolve which developmental processes are deuterostome innovations, which are innovations in other clades, and which are ancestral. However, the nervous system of echinoderms is one of the least understood of all major metazoan phyla. To gain insights into echinoderm neurogenesis, spatial and temporal gene expression data are essential. Then, functional data will enable the building of a detailed gene regulatory network for neurogenesis in the sea urchin that can be compared across metazoans to resolve questions about how nervous systems evolved. Results:Here, we analyze spatiotemporal gene expression during sea urchin neurogenesis for genes that have been shown to be neurogenic in one or more species. We report the expression of 21 genes expressed in areas of neurogenesis in the sea urchin embryo from blastula stage (just before neural progenitors begin their specification sequence) through pluteus larval stage (when much of the nervous system has been patterned). Among those 21 gene expression patterns, we report expression of 11 transcription factors and 2 axon guidance genes, each expressed in discrete domains in the neuroectoderm or in the endoderm. Most of these genes are expressed in and around the ciliary band. Some including the transcription factors Lv-mbx, Lv-dmrt, Lv-islet, and Lv-atbf1, the nuclear protein Lv-prohibitin, and the guidance molecule Lv-semaa are expressed in the endoderm where they are presumably involved in neurogenesis in the gut. Conclusions:This study builds a foundation to study how neurons are specified and evolved by analyzing spatial and temporal gene expression during neurogenesis in a basal deuterostome. With these expression patterns, we will be able to understand what genes are required for neural development in the sea urchin. These data can be used as a starting point to (1) build a spatial gene regulatory network for sea urchin neurogenesis, (2) identify how subtypes of neurons are specified, (3) perform comparative studies with the sea urchin, protostome, and vertebrate organisms.", "publication_location": "Evodevo", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13227-019-0115-8", "citations": "3", "readership": "11", "tweets": "13", "news_mentions": " "},

The mechanism by which neurons process the coding of signals is not well understood. Here, we propose that coincidence detection, one of the ways to describe the functionality of a single neural cell, can improve the reliability and the precision of signal detection through detection of presynaptic input synchrony. Using a simplified neuronal network model composed of dozens of integrate-and-fire neurons and a single coincidence-detector neuron, we show how the network reads out the subthreshold noisy signals reliably and precisely. We find suitable pairing parameters, the threshold and the detection time window of the coincidence-detector neuron, that optimize the precision and reliability of the neuron. Furthermore, it is observed that the refractory period induces an oscillation in the spontaneous firing, but the neuron can inhibit this activity and improve the reliability and precision further. In the case of intermediate intrinsic states of the input neuron, the network responds to the input more efficiently.

To study the mechanisms underlying SCS, we constructed a biophysically based network model of the dorsal horn circuit consisting of interconnected dorsal horn interneurons and a wide-dynamic range (WDR) projection neuron and representations of both local and surround receptive field inhibition. We validated the network model by reproducing cellular and network responses relevant to pain processing including wind-up, A fiber-mediated inhibition, and surround receptive field inhibition. We then simulated the effects of SCS on the activity of the WDR projection neuron and found that the response of the model WDR neuron to SCS depends on the SCS frequency; SCS frequencies of 30-100 Hz maximally inhibited the model WDR neuron, while frequencies under 30 Hz and over 100 Hz excited the model WDR neuron. We also studied the impacts on the effects of SCS of loss of inhibition due to the loss of either GABA or KCC2 function. Reducing the influence of local and surround GABAergic interneurons by weakening their inputs or their connections to the WDR neuron and shifting the anionic reversal potential of the WDR neurons upward each reduced the range of optimal SCS frequencies and changed the frequency at which SCS had a maximal effect.

We compared unmedicated individuals with MDD (n=100) to control participants (n=109) on dynamic RSFC (operationalized as SD in RSFC over a series of sliding windows) of an MPFC seed region during a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Among participants with MDD, we also investigated the relationship between symptom severity and RSFC. Secondary analyses probed the association between dynamic RSFC and rumination. Results showed that individuals with MDD were characterized by decreased dynamic (less variable) RSFC between MPFC and regions of parahippocampal gyrus within the default network, a pattern related to sustained positive connectivity between these regions across sliding windows. In contrast, the MDD group exhibited increased dynamic (more variable) RSFC between MPFC and regions of insula, and higher severity of depression was related to increased dynamic RSFC between MPFC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These patterns of highly variable RSFC were related to greater frequency of strong positive and negative correlations in activity across sliding windows. Secondary analyses indicated that increased dynamic RSFC between MPFC and insula was related to higher levels of recent rumination.

Here we compare native (L1) and non-native (L2) languages with 3 different nonspeech conditions including emotional voices, monkey calls, and phase scrambled sounds that provide more stringent controls. Hemodynamic responses to these stimuli were measured in the temporal areas of Japanese 4 month-olds. The results show clear left-lateralized responses to speech, prominently to L1, as opposed to various activation patterns in the nonspeech conditions. Furthermore, implementing a new analysis method designed for infants, we discovered a slower hemodynamic time course in awake infants. Our results are largely explained by signal-driven auditory processing. However, stronger activations to L1 than to L2 indicate a language-specific neural factor that modulates these responses.

RA's output during singing predicts individual notes, even though afferent drive to RA from the song nucleus HVc is more tonic, and predicts song syllables, independent of the particular notes that comprise the syllable. Therefore RA's intrinsic circuitry transforms neural activity from HVc into a highly precise premotor output. To understand how RA's intrinsic circuitry effects this transformation, we characterized RA interneurons and projection neurons using intracellular recordings in brain slices. RA interneurons fired fast action potentials with steep current-frequency relationships and had small somata with thin aspinous processes that extended throughout large portions of the nucleus; the similarity of their fine processes to those labeled with a glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody strongly suggests that these interneurons are GABAergic. Electrical stimulation revealed that RA interneurons receive excitatory inputs from RA's afferents, the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior neostriatum (LMAN) and HVc, and from local axon collaterals of RA projection neurons. To map the functional connections that RA interneurons make onto RA projection neurons, we focally uncaged glutamate, revealing long-range inhibitory connections in RA. Thus these interneurons provide fast feed-forward and feedback inhibition to RA projection neurons and could help create the phasic pattern of bursts and pauses that characterizes RA output during singing. Furthermore, selectively activating the inhibitory network phase locks the firing of otherwise unconnected pairs of projection neurons, suggesting that local inhibition could coordinate RA output during singing.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neurophysiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.1999.81.6.3007", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

One line of research concerns episodic future thinking, which involves simulating episodes that might occur in one's personal future, and the other concerns episodic counterfactual thinking, which involves simulating episodes that could have happened in one's personal past. We first review neuroimaging studies that have examined the neural underpinnings of episodic future thinking and episodic counterfactual thinking. We argue that these studies have revealed that the two forms of episodic simulation engage a common core network including medial parietal, prefrontal, and temporal regions that also supports episodic memory. We also note that neuroimaging studies have documented neural differences between episodic future thinking and episodic counterfactual thinking, including differences in hippocampal responses. We next consider behavioral studies that have delineated both similarities and differences between the two kinds of episodic simulation. The evidence indicates that episodic future and counterfactual thinking are characterized by similarly reduced levels of specific detail compared with episodic memory, but that the effects of repeatedly imagining a possible experience have sharply contrasting effects on the perceived plausibility of those events during episodic future thinking versus episodic counterfactual thinking.

In order to better understand potential genetic divergence underlying this variable risk, we studied genes responsible for monogenic IDs, grouped according to their autism and epilepsy comorbidities. METHODS:Utilizing 465 different forms of ID with known molecular origins, we accessed available genetic databases in conjunction with gene ontology (GO) to determine whether the genetics underlying ID diverge according to its comorbidities with autism and epilepsy and if genes highly penetrant for autism or epilepsy share distinctive features that set them apart from genes that confer comparatively variable or no apparent risk. RESULTS:The genetics of ID with autism are relatively enriched in terms associated with nervous system-specific processes and structural morphogenesis. In contrast, we find that ID with highly comorbid epilepsy (HCE) is modestly associated with lipid metabolic processes while ID without autism or epilepsy comorbidity (ID only) is enriched at the Golgi membrane. Highly comorbid autism (HCA) genes, on the other hand, are strongly enriched within the nucleus, are typically involved in regulation of gene expression, and, along with IDs with more variable autism, share strong ties with a core protein-protein interaction (PPI) network integral to basic patterning of the CNS. CONCLUSIONS:According to GO terminology, autism-related gene products are integral to neural development. While it is difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding IDs unassociated with autism, it is clear that the majority of HCA genes are tightly linked with general dysregulation of gene expression, suggesting that disturbances to the chronology of neural maturation and patterning may be key in conferring susceptibility to autism spectrum conditions.", "publication_location": "Molecular Autism", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13229-016-0082-z", "citations": "20", "readership": "73", "tweets": "20", "news_mentions": " "},

We present a new approach that dramatically reduces the complexity of this problem. Large-scale multi-electrode recordings were used to measure electrical activity in nearly complete, regularly spaced mosaics of several hundred ON and OFF parasol retinal ganglion cells in macaque monkey retina. Parasol cells exhibited substantial pairwise correlations, as has been observed in other species, indicating functional connectivity. However, pairwise measurements alone are insufficient to determine the prevalence of multi-neuron firing patterns, which would be predicted from widely diverging common inputs and have been hypothesized to convey distinct visual messages to the brain. The number of possible multi-neuron firing patterns is far too large to study exhaustively, but this problem may be circumvented if two simple rules of connectivity can be established: (1) multi-cell firing patterns arise from multiple pairwise interactions, and (2) interactions are limited to adjacent cells in the mosaic. Using maximum entropy methods from statistical mechanics, we show that pairwise and adjacent interactions accurately accounted for the structure and prevalence of multi-neuron firing patterns, explaining approximately 98% of the departures from statistical independence in parasol cells and approximately 99% of the departures that were reproducible in repeated measurements.

Design, Setting, and Participants: In study 1, treatment-seeking smokers (n = 81) completed an IC task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before making a quit attempt and then were followed up for 10 weeks after their quit date. In study 2, a separate group of smokers (n = 26) performed the same IC task during fMRI, followed by completing a laboratory-based smoking relapse analog task.

Results: Of the 81 study participants in study 1 (cessation study), 45 were women (56%), with mean (SD) age, 38.4 (10.2) years.

The input layer of the cerebellar cortex integrates diverse sensorimotor information to enable learned associations that refine the dynamics of movement. Specifically, mossy fiber afferents relay sensorimotor input into the cerebellum to excite granule cells, whose activity is regulated by inhibitory Golgi cells. To test how this integration can be modulated, we have used an acute brain slice preparation from young adult rats and found that encoding of mossy fiber input in the cerebellar granule cell layer can be regulated by serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) via a specific action on Golgi cells. We find that 5-HT depolarizes Golgi cells, likely by activating 5-HT2A receptors, but does not directly act on either granule cells or mossy fibers. As a result of Golgi cell depolarization, 5-HT significantly increases tonic inhibition onto both granule cells and Golgi cells. 5-HT-mediated Golgi cell depolarization is not sufficient, however, to alter the probability or timing of mossy fiber-evoked feed-forward inhibition onto granule cells. Together, increased granule cell tonic inhibition paired with normal feed-forward inhibition acts to reduce granule cell spike probability without altering spike timing. Hence, these data provide a circuit mechanism by which 5-HT can reduce granule cell activity without altering temporal representations of mossy fiber input. Such changes in network integration could enable flexible, state-specific suppression of cerebellar sensorimotor input that should not be learned or enable reversal learning for unwanted associations. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) regulates synaptic integration at the input stage of cerebellar processing by increasing tonic inhibition of granule cells.

Tremor varied significantly across stimulus conditions (P < 0.015), and stimulus trains with pauses were significantly less effective than stimulus trains without (P < 0.002). There were no significant differences in tremor between trains with or without bursts or between trains that were irregular or periodic. Thus the decreased effectiveness of temporally irregular DBS trains is due to long pauses in the stimulus trains, not the degree of temporal irregularity alone. We also conducted computer simulations of neuronal responses to the experimental stimulus trains using a biophysical model of the thalamic network. Trains that suppressed tremor in volunteers also suppressed fluctuations in thalamic transmembrane potential at the frequency associated with cerebellar burst-driver inputs. Clinical and computational findings indicate that DBS suppresses tremor by masking burst-driver inputs to the thalamus and that pauses in stimulation prevent such masking. Although stimulation of other anatomic targets may provide tremor suppression, we propose that the most relevant neuronal targets for effective tremor suppression are the afferent cerebellar fibers that terminate in the thalamus.", "publication_location": "J Neurophysiol", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00906.2010", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in both executive attention and affective regulation. This study aims to elucidate the neural correlates of emotion-attention regulation and shifting in schizophrenia. METHOD: We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging to probe the fronto-limbic regions in 16 adults with schizophrenia and 13 matched adults with no history of psychiatric illness. Subjects performed a forced-choice visual oddball task where they detected infrequent target circles embedded in a series of infrequent nontarget aversive and neutral pictures and frequent squares. RESULTS: In control participants, target events activated a dorsal frontoparietal network, whereas these regions were deactivated by aversive stimuli. Conversely, ventral frontolimbic brain regions were activated by aversive stimuli and deactivated by target events. In the patient group, regional hemodynamic timecourses revealed not only reduced activation to target and aversive events in dorsal executive and ventral limbic regions, respectively, but also reduced deactivation to target and aversive stimuli in ventral and dorsal regions, respectively, relative to the control group. Patients further showed reduced spatial extent of activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus during the target and aversive conditions. Activation of the anterior cingulate to aversive images was inversely related to severity of avolition and anhedonia symptoms in the schizophrenia group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest both frontal and limbic dysfunction in schizophrenia as well as aberrant reciprocal inhibitions between these regions during attention-emotion modulation in this disorder.", "publication_location": "Schizophrenia Bulletin", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbn118", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

The promise of such recordings has inspired great progress in methods for surgically implanting large numbers of metal electrodes into intact rodent brains. However, methods for localizing the precise location of these electrodes have remained severely lacking. Traditional histological techniques that require slicing and staining of physical brain tissue are cumbersome, and become increasingly impractical as the number of implanted electrodes increases. Here we solve these problems by describing a method that registers 3-D computerized tomography (CT) images of intact rat brains implanted with metal electrode bundles to a Magnetic Resonance Imaging Histology (MRH) Atlas. Our method allows accurate visualization of each electrode bundle's trajectory and location without removing the electrodes from the brain or surgically implanting external markers. In addition, unlike physical brain slices, once the 3D images of the electrode bundles and the MRH atlas are registered, it is possible to verify electrode placements from many angles by \"re-slicing\" the images along different planes of view. Further, our method can be fully automated and easily scaled to applications with large numbers of specimens. Our digital imaging approach to efficiently localizing metal electrodes offers a substantial addition to currently available methods, which, in turn, may help accelerate the rate at which insights are gleaned from rodent network neuroscience.", "publication_location": "Eneuro", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0017-15.2015", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Recent behavioral data have documented that WM biases of attention may be subject to strategic cognitive control processes whereby subjects are able to either enhance or inhibit the influence of WM contents on attention. However, the neural mechanisms supporting cognitive control over WM biases on attention are presently unknown. Here, we characterize these mechanisms by combining human functional magnetic resonance imaging with a task that independently manipulates the relationship between WM cues and attention targets during visual search (with WM contents matching either search targets or distracters), as well as the predictability of this relationship (100 vs 50% predictability) to assess participants' ability to strategically enhance or inhibit WM biases on attention when WM contents reliably matched targets or distracter stimuli, respectively. We show that cues signaling predictable (> unpredictable) WM-attention relations reliably enhanced search performance, and that this strategic modulation of the interplay between WM contents and visual attention was mediated by a neuroanatomical network involving the posterior parietal cortex, the posterior cingulate, and medial temporal lobe structures, with responses in the hippocampus proper correlating with behavioral measures of strategic control of WM biases.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that a crucial determinant of this modulation is whether affective stimuli represent performance-contingent or task-irrelevant signals. Combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with a conflict task-switching paradigm, we contrasted the effects of presenting negative- and positive-valence pictures on the stability/flexibility trade-off in humans, depending on whether picture presentation was contingent on behavioral performance. Both the behavioral and neural expressions of cognitive control were modulated by stimulus valence and performance contingency: in the performance-contingent condition, cognitive flexibility was enhanced following positive pictures, whereas in the nonperformance-contingent condition, positive stimuli promoted cognitive stability. The imaging data showed that, as anticipated, the stability/flexibility trade-off per se was reflected in differential recruitment of dorsolateral frontoparietal and striatal regions. In contrast, the affective modulation of stability/flexibility shifts was mirrored, unexpectedly, by neural responses in ventromedial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, core nodes of the \"default mode\" network. Our results demonstrate that the affective modulation of cognitive control depends on the performance contingency of the affect-inducing stimuli, and they document medial default mode regions to mediate the flexibility-promoting effects of performance-contingent positive affect, thus extending recent work that recasts these regions as serving a key role in on-task control processes.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neuroscience", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1208-13.2013", "citations": "43", "readership": "159", "tweets": "3", "news_mentions": " "},

However, the neurobiological basis of abstinence effects on resolving emotional interference on cognition remains largely uncharacterized. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate smoking abstinence effects on emotion-cognition interactions. METHODS: Smokers (n = 17) underwent fMRI while performing an affective Stroop task (aST) over two sessions: once following 24-h abstinence and once following smoking as usual. The aST includes trials that serially present incongruent or congruent numerical grids bracketed by neutral or negative emotional distractors and view-only emotional image trials. Statistical analyses were conducted using a statistical threshold of p < 0.05 cluster corrected. RESULTS: Smoking abstinence increased Stroop blood-oxygenation-level-dependent response in the right middle frontal and rostral anterior cingulate gyri. Moreover, withdrawal-induced negative affect was associated with less activation in frontoparietal regions during negative emotional information processing; whereas, during Stroop trials, negative affect predicted greater activation in frontal regions during negative, but not neutral emotional distractor trials. CONCLUSION: Hyperactivation in the frontal executive control network during smoking abstinence may represent a need to recruit additional executive resources to meet task demands. Moreover, abstinence-induced negative affect may disrupt cognitive control neural circuitry during EIP and place additional demands on frontal executive neural resources during cognitive demands when presented with emotionally distracting stimuli.", "publication_location": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00213-011-2522-y", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

Striatal medium spiny neurons are proposed to detect the coincident activity of specific beat patterns of cortical oscillations, thereby permitting the discrimination of supra-second durations based upon the reoccurring patterns of subsecond neural firing. This proposal for the cortico-striatal representation of time is consistent with the observed psychophysical properties of interval timing (e.g. linear time scale and scalar variance) as well as much of the available pharmacological, lesion, patient, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging data from animals and humans (e.g. dopamine-related timing deficits in Huntington's and Parkinson's disease as well as related animal models).

Mutations in the human NR2E3 gene and its mouse ortholog are associated with enhanced S-cones and retinal degeneration. In order to gain insights into the NR2E3 function, we performed temporal and spatial expression analysis, yeast two-hybrid screening, promoter activity assays and co-immunoprecipitation studies. The Nr2e3 expression was localized preferentially to the rod, and not to the cone, photoreceptor nuclei in rodent retina. The yeast two-hybrid screening of a retinal cDNA library, using NR2E3 as the bait, identified another orphan nuclear receptor NR1D1 (Rev-erbalpha). The interaction of NR2E3 with NR1D1 was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In transient transfection studies using HEK 293 cells, both NR2E3 and NR1D1 activated the promoters of rod phototransduction genes synergistically with neural retina leucine zipper (NRL) and cone-rod homeobox (CRX). All four proteins, NR2E3, NR1D1, NRL and CRX, could be co-immunoprecipitated from the bovine retinal nuclear extract, suggesting their existence in a multi-protein transcriptional regulatory complex in vivo.

In the case of primary sensory cortex, a decrease in mean evoked firing rate of parvalbumin-positive (PV) inhibitory neurons is causally linked to a reorganization of excitatory networks following sensory perturbation. Converging evidence indicates that it is deprivation, and not an imbalance between open- and closed-eye inputs, that triggers rapid plasticity in PV neurons. However, this has not been directly tested in vivo. Using two-photon guided cell-attached recording, we examined the impact of closing both eyes for 24 h on PV neuron response properties in mouse primary visual cortex. We found that binocular deprivation induces a 30% reduction in stimulus-evoked mean firing rate and that this reduction is specific to critical period-aged mice. The number of PV neurons showing detectable tuning to orientation increased after 24 h of deprivation, and this effect was also specific to critical period-aged mice. In contrast to evoked mean firing rate and orientation tuning, measurements of trial-to-trial variability revealed that stimulus-driven decreases in variability are significantly dampened by deprivation during both the critical period and the postcritical period. These data establish that open-eye inputs are not required to drive deprivation-induced weakening of PV neuron evoked activity and that other aspects of in vivo PV neuron activity are malleable throughout life. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Parvalbumin-positive (PV) neurons in sensory cortex are generally considered to be mediators of experience-dependent plasticity, and their plasticity is restricted to the critical period. However, in regions outside of sensory cortex, accumulating evidence demonstrates that PV neurons are plastic in adults, raising the possibility that aspects of PV response properties may be plastic throughout life.

We show that NRL expression, in both genetic backgrounds, leads to a functional retina with only rod photoreceptors. The absence of cones does not alter retinal lamination, although cone synaptic circuitry is now recruited by rods. Ectopic expression of NRL in developing cones can also induce rod-like characteristics and partially suppress cone-specific gene expression. We show that NRL is associated with specific promoter sequences in Thrb (encoding TRbeta2 transcription factor required for M-cone differentiation) and S-opsin and may, therefore, directly participate in transcriptional suppression of cone development.

Its pathogenesis is thought to involve large-scale alterations to the expression of genes controlling neurotransmitter signalling, ion channels, synaptic structure, neuronal death, gliosis, and inflammation. Identification of mechanisms coordinating gene networks in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy will help to identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNAs that control the expression levels of multiple proteins by decreasing mRNA stability and translation, and could therefore be key regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic targets in epilepsy.In the past 5 years, studies have found changes in miRNA levels in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and in neural tissues from animal models of epilepsy. Early functional studies showed that silencing of brain-specific miR-134 using antisense oligonucleotides (antagomirs) had potent antiseizure effects in animal models, whereas genetic deletion of miR-128 produced fatal epilepsy in mice. Levels of certain miRNAs were also found to be altered in the blood of rodents after seizures. In the past 18 months, functional studies have identified nine novel miRNAs that appear to influence seizures or hippocampal pathology. Their targets include transcription factors, neurotransmitter signalling components, and modulators of neuroinflammation. New approaches to manipulate miRNAs have been tested, including injection of mimics (agomirs) to enhance brain levels of miRNAs. Altered miRNA expression has also been reported in other types of refractory epilepsy and our understanding of how miRNA levels are controlled has grown, with studies on DNA methylation indicating epigenetic regulation. Biofluids (blood) of patients with epilepsy have shown differences in quantity of circulating miRNAs, implying diagnostic biomarker potential. WHERE NEXT?: Recent functional studies need to be replicated to build a robust evidence base. The specific cell types in which miRNAs execute their functions and their primary targets have to be identified, to fully explain the phenotypic effects of modulating miRNAs. Delivery of large molecules such as antisense inhibitors or mimics to the brain poses a challenge, and the multi-targeting effects of miRNAs create additional risks of unanticipated side effects. Potential genetic variation in miRNAs should be explored as the basis for disease susceptibility.

Original ganglia in the muscular nervous plexus of the stomach appeared at ED15 with very simple arrangement. At ED 16 the early developed myenteric nervous plexuses were regularly found in the stomach and intestine respectively. In both stomach and intestine, the development of submucosal nervous plexuses were finished at ED17. However, the myenteric nervous plexus and the internal and external submucosal nervous plexuses were differentiated only in the stomach at ED 18.In comparison with the normal littermates, stomach and intestine nervous system developed much slower in trisomy 16 mice. Their immature neurons did not appear in the stomach and intestine until ED 14 and ED 15. Between ED 14 and ED 16, the gastroenteric nervous system was composed of only some scattered neurons with different distribution density and size. The development and differentiation of the gastroenteric nervous system were delayed and the myenteric nervous plexus did not appear until ED 18. There was no submucosal nervous plexus in all stomach and intestine specimens. A semiquantitative analysis and rank sum test of the data showed that the trisomy 16 mouse embryos were markedly retarded in the gastroenteric nervous development compared with their normal littermates.CONCLUSION:Trisomy 16 mice, as an animal model for Down syndrome, has abnormality not only in several systems and organs but also in gastroenteric innervation. This report describes for the first time that the development of the gastroenteric nervous system was not only delayed but also pathological.", "publication_location": "World Journal of Gastroenterology", "link": null, "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

To elucidate PFC contributions to storage and rehearsal/maintenance processes engaged during verbal working memory function, we assessed behavior of patients with lesions to the left or right lateral PFC, and neural activity of healthy young subjects during fMRI scanning, during performance of working memory tasks. We found that PFC lesions did not affect storage processes--which is consistent with the notion that posterior cortical networks can support simple retention of information. We also found that PFC lesions did not affect rehearsal/maintenance processes, which was in contrast to our finding that healthy subjects performing a verbal delayed recognition task showed bilateral PFC activation. These combined imaging and behavioral data suggest that working memory rehearsal/maintenance processes may depend on both hemispheres, which may have implications for recovery of function and development of rehabilitation therapies after frontal injury.", "publication_location": "Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : Jins", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355617706060322", "citations": "53", "readership": "137", "tweets": "1", "news_mentions": " "},

Higher-order sensory cortical areas, with their increasingly complex receptive fields and integrative properties, are thought to be critical nodes for this function. This is especially true in the primate visual cortex, in which functionally specialized areas are engaged in parallel streams to support diverse computations. Recent anatomical and physiological studies of the mouse visual cortex have revealed a similarly complex network of specialized higher-order areas. This structure provides a useful model for determining the synaptic and circuit mechanisms through which information is transformed across distinct processing stages. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the layout, connectivity, and functional properties of the higher visual areas in the mouse. In addition, we speculate on the contribution of these areas to perception and action, and how knowledge of the mouse visual system can inform us about the principles that govern information processing in integrated networks.", "publication_location": "Annu Rev Vis Sci", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-vision-102016-061331", "citations": "41", "readership": "190", "tweets": "4", "news_mentions": " "},

Four major classes of axon guidance molecules--the ephrins, netrins, slits, and semaphorins--provide targeting information to outgrowing axons along predetermined pathways during development. These molecules may also play a role in synaptic reorganization in the adult brain and thereby promote epileptogenesis. We studied semaphorin gene expression, as assessed by in situ hybridization, using riboprobes generated from rat cDNA in an adult model of synaptic reorganization, kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE). Within the first week after KA-induced SE, semaphorin 3C, a class III semaphorin, mRNA content is decreased in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and is increased in the upper layers of cerebral cortex. Another class III semaphorin, semaphorin 3F, is also decreased in CA1 and CA3 of hippocampus within the first week after KA-SE. These changes in gene expression are principally confined to neurons. By contrast, there was little change in the semaphorin 4C mRNA content of CA1 neurons at this time. No changes in expression of semaphorin 3A and 4C genes were detected 28 days after KA-induced SE. Regulation of semaphorin gene expression after KA-induced SE suggests that neurons may regulate the expression of axonal guidance molecules and thereby contribute to synaptic reorganization after injury of the mature brain. The anatomic locale of the altered semaphorin gene expression may serve as a marker for specific networks undergoing synaptic reorganization in the epileptic brain.", "publication_location": "Hippocampus", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hipo.10041", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

How and where distorted feedback interacts with song motor networks to induce this process of song decrystallization remains unknown. The song premotor nucleus HVC is a potential site where auditory feedback signals could interact with song motor commands. Although the forebrain nucleus interface of the nidopallium (NIf) appears to be the primary auditory input to HVC, NIf lesions made in adult zebra finches do not trigger song decrystallization. One possibility is that NIf lesions do not interfere with song maintenance, but do compromise the adult zebra finch's ability to express renewed vocal plasticity in response to feedback perturbations. To test this idea, we bilaterally lesioned NIf and then transected the vocal nerve in adult male zebra finches. We found that bilateral NIf lesions did not prevent nerve section-induced song decrystallization. To test the extent to which the NIf lesions disrupted auditory processing in the song system, we made in vivo extracellular recordings in HVC and a downstream anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) in NIf-lesioned birds. We found strong and selective auditory responses to the playback of the birds' own song persisted in HVC and the AFP following NIf lesions. These findings suggest that auditory inputs to the song system other than NIf, such as the caudal mesopallium, could act as a source of auditory feedback signals to the song motor network.", "publication_location": "Journal of Neurophysiology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.00293.2009", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "},

If such spinal interneuronal circuits could be activated, they could provide the coordinated control of many muscles that is so complex to implement with a device that aims to address each participating muscle individually. The authors' goal is to identify candidate spinal circuits and areas of research that might open opportunities to effect control of human limbs through electrical activation of such circuits. David McCrea's discussion of the ways in which hindlimb reflexes in the cat modify motor activity may help in developing optimal strategies for functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS), by using knowledge of how reflex actions can adapt to different conditions. Michael O'Donovan's discussion of the development of rhythmogenic networks in the chick embryo may provide clues to methods of generating rhythmic activity in the adult spinal cord. Serge Rossignol examines the spinal pattern generator for locomotion in cats, its trigger mechanisms, modulation and adaptation, and suggests how this knowledge can help guide therapeutic approaches in humans. Hugues Barbeau applies the work of Rossignol and others to locomotor training in human subjects who have suffered spinal cord injury (SCI) with incomplete motor function loss (IMFL). Michel Lemay and Warren Grill discuss some of the technical challenges that must be addressed by engineers to implement a neuroprosthesis using electrical stimulation of the spinal cord, particularly the control issues that would have to be resolved.", "publication_location": "Brain Research.

We found an all-or-none difference in the problem-solving capacity of the two species. Brain RNA sequencing analyses revealed interspecific differences in genes related to neuronal and synaptic plasticity in the intrapallial neural populations (mesopallium and nidopallium), especially in the nidopallium caudolaterale, a structure functionally analogous to the mammalian prefrontal cortex. At a finer scale, we discovered robust differences in glutamate receptor expression between the species. In particular, the GRIN2B/GRIN2A ratio, known to correlate with synaptic plasticity, was higher in the innovative L. barbadensis.

We addressed in vivo functions of βII-spectrin in neurons by knockout of βII-spectrin in mouse neural progenitors. βII-spectrin deficiency caused severe defects in long-range axonal connectivity and axonal degeneration. βII-spectrin-null neurons exhibited reduced axon growth, loss of actin-spectrin-based periodic membrane skeleton, and impaired bidirectional axonal transport of synaptic cargo. We found that βII-spectrin associates with KIF3A, KIF5B, KIF1A, and dynactin, implicating spectrin in the coupling of motors and synaptic cargo. βII-spectrin required phosphoinositide lipid binding to promote axonal transport and restore axon growth. Knockout of ankyrin-B (AnkB), a βII-spectrin partner, primarily impaired retrograde organelle transport, while double knockout of βII-spectrin and AnkB nearly eliminated transport. Thus, βII-spectrin promotes both axon growth and axon stability through establishing the actin-spectrin-based membrane-associated periodic skeleton as well as enabling axonal transport of synaptic cargo.", "publication_location": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1820649116", "citations": "10", "readership": "28", "tweets": "21", "news_mentions": " "},

Because homeostatic mechanisms buffer traits against environmental and genetic variation they allow the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation. Homeostatic mechanisms are never perfect and can be destabilized by mutations in genes that alter the kinetics of the underlying mechanism. We use mathematical models to study five diverse mechanisms of homeostasis: thermoregulation; maintenance of homocysteine concentration; neural control by a feed forward circuit; the myogenic response in the kidney; and regulation of extracellular dopamine levels in the brain. In all these cases there are homeostatic regions where the trait is relatively insensitive to genetic or environmental variation, flanked by regions where it is sensitive. Moreover, mutations or environmental changes can place an individual closer to the edge of the homeostatic region, thus predisposing that individual to deleterious effects caused by additional mutations or environmental changes. Mutations and environmental variables can also reduce the size of the homeostatic region, thus releasing potentially deleterious cryptic genetic variation. These considerations of mutations, environment, homeostasis, and escape from homeostasis help to explain why the etiology of so many diseases is complex.", "publication_location": "Mathematical Biosciences", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2014.08.015", "citations": " ", "readership": " ", "tweets": " ", "news_mentions": " "}
